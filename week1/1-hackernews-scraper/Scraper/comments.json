  "text": "j is abstract. It seems like it should be easier if it is concrete, but I find that this tends to lead to assumptions and encourages scanning instead of reading.<p>When I sit down to a program, I have an idea about what I want to do. I don&#x27;t have home&#x2F;end keys on my keyboard and I note that pressing Fn-Left and Fn-Right is annoying because I don&#x27;t usually push them (I use emacs sometimes). So when I sit down to edit I want to add emacs keys.<p>I can see at <a href=\"http://kparc.com/z.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kparc.com&#x2F;z.txt</a> that hx handles home&#x2F;end, and that cX is control-X, so I think it should be something like:<p><pre><code>    ca:{hx 0 -1};ce:{hx 0 1}\n</code></pre>\nNow I look at the characters spent: Is it possible I could say this simpler? I don&#x27;t think so, but I&#x27;d love someone to tell me.<p>How about delete? I think what I want to do is select the next character and remove it. So where is the cursor? Well I remembered that hx moves the cursor, so I read it&#x27;s definition:<p><pre><code>    hx:{L i+d*x}\n</code></pre>\nOkay, so I remember d is &quot;dimensions&quot; and &quot;i&quot; is something, and L I haven&#x27;t seen yet. So I go look at L:<p><pre><code>    L:{K@B&#x2F;0|x&amp;d-1}\n</code></pre>\nNow I have two new words: K and B to look up:<p><pre><code>    B:{c[x]&amp;y+b x}\n    K:{J(;|\\(*k),)[H]x}\n</code></pre>\nOkay, B is straightforward: b is indexed by line, so b x returns the offset of line x. We add this to y (which is the second value of |x&amp;d-1) and take the min of it and the offset for c. I might think at this point B converts the x&#x2F;y coordinate into a linear offset. But what about K?<p>K is using J and H (but it turns out we only need J):<p><pre><code>    J:{k::2#0|x&amp;-1+#a}\n</code></pre>\nAnd here we see the definition of k: x&amp;-1+#a is the smallest of x and the second to last character in the file (a), and the max of that and zero (0|). This reads like &quot;bounds check x to the shape of a&quot;. Taking 2 from that simply takes two values and assigns them to k so if x is only one-value k will still have two.<p>k is the cursor selection.<p>From here, I can make an attempt at implementing delete. My first attempt looked something like:<p><pre><code>    cd{a::((0,k)_a),(((k+1),(#a)-(k+1)))_a}\n</code></pre>\nOh! But I&#x27;ve seen a lot of these terms before! Maybe I can do better. I note that kx is documented as the callback for keystrokes <a href=\"http://kparc.com/z.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kparc.com&#x2F;z.txt</a> and can come up with:<p><pre><code>    cd:{K j+!2;kx&quot;&quot;}\n</code></pre>\nThis seems about as simple as I can make it. I&#x27;d like to see someone do better, but <i>knowing</i> that K is a setter for the cursor selection and j is the offset of the cursor, then j+!2 simply returns offset and offset+1; K will select it and kx&quot;&quot; will remove it.<p>Now maybe if k were called cursorSelection I might have gotten my first cd faster, but I would&#x27;ve missed the opportunity to see how these functions and variables were interconnected and I might not have written the second one.<p>I noticed however, that not scrolling really helped this exercise. I just moved my eyes around, and jotted a few symbols down on my notepad. I feel like if I had to scroll or switch windows I would not have been able to do this.<p>As for your last question: What does one need to master it? For now, I would say practice. Try writing a program in as dense a manner as possible. Remove as much redundancy as you can. Read it and re-read it until you feel like it can be no more abstract.<p>I am working on a much better answer, but I hope that one will do for now.",

If anybody wants to dig deeper to articles like this, I have to mention the Hugi Coding Digest[1](executable &quot;diskmag&quot;) from 2003 which contains all the articles related to programming from Hugi #11 to Hugi #27, including this one.<p>The <i>topics</i> of the articles are as follows: &quot;Mathematics &amp; Theoretical Computer Science&quot;, &quot;General Programming Techniques&quot;, &quot;Searching &amp; Sorting&quot;, &quot;Object-Orientated Programming&quot;, &quot;File Formats&quot;, &quot;Text Processing&quot;, &quot;2D Graphics Programming&quot;, &quot;3D Graphics Programming&quot;, &quot;Windows Graphics Programming (GDI, DirectDraw, Direct3D)&quot;, &quot;OpenGL&quot;, &quot;Sound Programming&quot;, &quot;Synchronization &amp; Scripting for Demos&quot;, &quot;Hardware-centered Programming&quot;, &quot;Code Optimization, FPU&quot;, &quot;Data Compression&quot;, &quot;64k, 4k and even smaller intros&quot;, &quot;Windows&quot;, &quot;Linux&quot;, &quot;Other Non-Wintel platforms&quot;, &quot;Active Server Pages&quot;, &quot;ActiveX&quot;, &quot;Assembler&quot;, &quot;C++&quot;, &quot;Flash&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;PHP&quot;, &quot;Other Programming Languages&quot;, &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;.<p>Hell, it also has some nice tracker music on the background.<p>Obviously the format is a bit cumbersome -- but I think it&#x27;s a good dive into the demoscene culture. Also most of the articles are written by hobbyists -- the real young hackers (oh and a few crackers too!) who just want to share what they have learned.<p>I think it should run natively on Windows and runs on Linux via Wine. Just launch the hugicode.exe -- of course with appropriate security caution, and if you trust me, Hugi and scene.org to have no malicious intent. :)<p>Why is the hacking culture like this dead? It was still somewhat well alive just 10 years ago, never mind 15 or 20 years ago. Even after so many years, it still saddens me to look back into gems like this Hugi Special Digest from a decade ago and see it forgotten and gone. Not just the contents or the release itself, but the <i>computing culture</i> which has died along with the demoscene.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.scene.org/file.php?file=/mags/hugi/hugise01.zip&amp;fileinfo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scene.org&#x2F;file.php?file=&#x2F;mags&#x2F;hugi&#x2F;hugise01.zip&amp;...</a>",

The nodes are multi-core and threads divvy up the work of rendering the image in tiles.  That&#x27;s not to say that production renderers can&#x27;t do multi-process renders too, but you don&#x27;t see it nearly as often as multi-threaded renders.  Remember that it can often take several minutes just to read scenes in; even if you split up an image into individual pixels and gave each node just a single pixel to do there&#x27;d still be a limit to how quickly you could get a frame back.  So if you parallelize across your cluster on frames, then yes, there&#x27;s usually several hours latency for a frame sequence, but you also get much better throughput.<p>By the way, if you haven&#x27;t heard of Blinn&#x27;s Law [0], you may find it interesting.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://blog.boxxtech.com/2013/07/15/blinns-law-and-the-paradox-of-increasing-performance/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.boxxtech.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;blinns-law-and-the-parad...</a>",

You will still be able to use sysvinit if you like. There is choice. The majority wants systemd. The minority wants sysvinit. Only because the opposers are loud and make a lot of noise about this doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they are a relatively small number. Changing the default is the only sane thing to do.",

  "text": "&gt; First, it is not equivalent - next() cannot apply to range() output, for example - you will need to do some iter() games and watch out for iteration order side effects if your values are iterators vs. lists.<p>It uses generator&#x2F;iteration semantics instead of list semantics. If you wrap the whole thing with a decorator like function that does:<p><pre><code>    def scan_wrapper(f, x0, x):\n        return list(scan(f, iter(x), x0)\n</code></pre>\nYou get the <i>exact</i> same semantics. For most cases (including the one you cited), the alternate semantics are actually better, more flexible, and avoid requiring a list to be built in the first place.<p>No problem with iteration order side effects either unless your f() somehow invalidates your iterable... and you still have some potential exposure there in your original implementation.<p>&gt; Second, it is ~10% faster...\n&gt; It potentially uses less memory...<p>Yeah, I think you are understating it to say the least. Not only are you using less memory, but you are saving having to rejuggle&#x2F;resize the list all the time.<p>&gt; (unless Python 3 gained TCO when I wasn&#x27;t looking. Did it?)<p>I guess in a way it sort of did for the case of yield from: &#x27;The iterator is run to exhaustion, during which time it yields and receives values directly to or from the caller of the generator containing the yield from expression (the &quot;delegating generator&quot;).&#x27;<p>So, even without full on TCO (which is still possible... I&#x27;m not sure if they did it with yield from), you at least have direct pass through from the generator to the caller. Because of iterator semantics, that should mean that each of the generators gets created on an as needed basis and the previous generator should get destroyed right thereafter. It is possible though that it isn&#x27;t quite doing it right, in which case I&#x27;ll concede that I&#x27;m still allocating an N deep generator stack, but that is still likely to be more memory efficient because it isn&#x27;t having to reallocate&#x2F;resize&#x2F;copy increasingly larger lists throughout the execution.<p>&gt; recursive solutions without TCO are rarely good enough to replace iteration.<p>As I mentioned, you can do the recursive solution as well, and it has the advantage of working with old Python. Still simpler and still far more efficient (here it is with extra wrapping to keep the semantics the same):<p><pre><code>    def scan(f, x0, x):\n        def scan_helper():\n            yield x0\n            for x1 in x:\n                x0 = f(x0, x)\n                yield x0\n        return list(scan_helper())\n</code></pre>\n&gt; It is mostly space-efficient in general.<p>You say that like when doing statistical analysis space-efficiency isn&#x27;t a concern...<p>&gt; I think it is more idiomatic, though - and also Python2 compatible - to just replace references to &#x27;r&#x27; with yield in my code, than using the recursive definition you gave above - which is more idiomatic in functional languages, but less in Python (and harder to debug in any language than the iterative version)<p>I was actually mostly getting at using yield instead of list append. I was just trying to express it as tersely as possible, which unsurprisingly became Python 3 and a functional style mechanism.<p>While I agree that often there is a struggle to understand functional programming, I think in this case it is very idiomatic Python (particularly since they defined &quot;yield from&quot; specifically for cases like this), and the code is <i>very</i> simple, readable, and easier to verify for correctness.",

Instead of putting the configuration in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;crypttab, which confuses systemd indeed, you can still use the kernel cryptopts variable. For example, in the grub configuration add something like:<p>cryptopts=source=&#x2F;dev&#x2F;&lt;disk&gt;,target=sdc5_crypt,keyscript=&#x2F;lib&#x2F;cryptsetup&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;passdev,key=&#x2F;dev&#x2F;&lt;other_disk&gt;:&#x2F;somdir&#x2F;root.key<p>Anf then in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;fstab use the &#x2F;dev&#x2F;mapper&#x2F;&lt;target&gt; (sdc5_crypt in the example above) as the root device, as before.<p>Then you need to make sure the initramfs contains all the tools needed to support this (that was done automatically with &#x2F;etc&#x2F;crypttab, it&#x27;s &quot;manual&quot; with the kernel option). To do this, add under &#x2F;etc&#x2F;initramfs-tools&#x2F;hooks a script file to load what&#x27;s needed in the initramfs: cryptsetup, passdev, the needed kernel module. You can roughly copy the existing &#x2F;usr&#x2F;share&#x2F;initramfs-tools&#x2F;hooks&#x2F;cryptroot and simplify it.<p>I&#x27;ve seen other distro documenting the kernel approach instead of &#x2F;etc&#x2F;crypttab for the root filesystem. It may become the standard way in the future, and there&#x27;s no reason it couldn&#x27;t be fully automated. There&#x27;s some coordination between several components so it may take a bit of time to converge to an accepted and supported way thought.",

On a server I don&#x27;t care about displays, keyboards, backlighting, sound, USB disks, mics, scanners etc. On my desktop they are very important. There are a number of companies offering Linux VPSes with 512 MB RAM and they can be good to host a low traffic web service. Good luck running a modern Linux DE on a 512 MB machine. Not impossibile but not very productive.<p>So I can imagine having very different init systems for desktops and servers if this means that the server won&#x27;t be encumbered by a number subsystems which are of no use to it. Furthermore binaries instead of scripts and opaque log files leave a bad taste in my mouth. They make me figure a future with a Windows like event viewer to browse the log files, over a terminal based ssh connection. I&#x27;m quite concerned about it. It will waive one of the biggest advantages of a Linux server over a Windows one.<p>A fork, or an alternative init system, could be a good solution.

It was 10% faster with a call to &#x27;r.append&#x27;, and within 0.1% with the append lookup hoisted out of the loop, on 1000 external iterations over 50,000 list items, minimum of 3, inconsistent which version was faster. my scanned function was def f(x,y): return max(0,x+y)<p>&gt; You get the exact same semantics. For most cases (including the one you cited), the alternate semantics are actually better, more flexible, and avoid requiring a list to be built in the first place.<p>range() on Python3 is not a list, and the original works on it and yet you needed scan_wrapper(). I didn&#x27;t try to fix it - I just tried to use your version and stumbled on the differences.<p>&gt; but that is still likely to be more memory efficient because it isn&#x27;t having to reallocate&#x2F;resize&#x2F;copy increasingly larger lists throughout the execution.<p>Instead you allocate a generator state each time. Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference in practice (I&#x27;ve measured) - the python lists grow exponentially, so we have e.g. 20 allocations+copies instead of 1,000,000 generator state allocations. I would have expected the list to be faster - but there&#x27;s no measurable difference.<p>&gt; As I mentioned, you can do the recursive solution as well, and it has the advantage of working with old Python. Still simpler and still far more efficient (here it is with extra wrapping to keep the semantics the same):<p>Recursive takes about 10 times more memory. Seriously - no TCO means call stacks are not free. Instead of one object which I stored, you store about 10 in each call frame!<p>But yes, your latest version is the idiomatic preferred version style, IMO: it&#x27;s also the most efficient. (And unlike the earlier python3 functional, it doesn&#x27;t need a helper to fix the INPUT)<p>&gt; You say that like when doing statistical analysis space-efficiency isn&#x27;t a concern...<p>Of course it&#x27;s a concern. I&#x27;m not saying it is not useful, I&#x27;m saying it is overrated, especially when compared to recursive solutions, which -- in python -- cost about 10 times more in stack space then you save in list space.<p>&gt; I was just trying to express it as tersely as possible, which unsurprisingly became Python 3 and a functional style mechanism.<p>... and taking much more memory in the process, though believing that you are using less. Not blaming you - python overlooks these things. One of K&#x27;s nice features is that the costs are mostly evident on a cursory look.<p>&gt; I think in this case it is very idiomatic Python (particularly since they defined &quot;yield from&quot; specifically for cases like this), and the code is very simple, readable, and easier to verify for correctness.<p>The recursive functional version is speedwise comparable, and spacewise much less efficient than my (admittedly, stupid) version. It is easier to prove formally, but harder to debug with a debugger because of the generator stack (which is a call stack, even though it does not exhaust the C call stack like regular calls do).<p>Can we agree that your latest scan(), if we dropped the two lines that have &quot;scan_helper&quot; in them, is the most efficient, most idiomatic, most (py2 and py3) compatible and clearest?",

The employee gets some form of training and employment, and the non-profit gets funds to repeat the process (often supplemented with donations).<p>A lot of their products and services could be sold on-line. However, e-commerce is not an easy task, nor is it necessarily cheap (I&#x27;ve worked in the industry for several years now). It also distracts from the non-profits main mission, whatever that may be.<p>The non-profit I want to start would provide e-commerce as a service to other non-profits: getting more customers for the products they sell or services they deliver, reducing their time spent on fundraising, and allowing them to focus more on their mission.<p>Commercially, the margins on non-profit products and services tend to be quite high; and non-profits (in particular charities) are used to paying a % of donations in fundraising costs. As a non-profit delivering this service, 65% of profits must be re-invested back into delivering it [the service]. However, as a community interest company, 35% of profits can be distributed as dividends. For reference, JustGiving (a for-profit) raises tens of millions for charities, and has revenue of 16MM&#x2F;year.",

  "text": "Hard data on decision making, and a better understanding of the way people think. The historical insights (including snapshots of how people lived and thought three or more generations ago) is a welcome bonus. So is gaining a better understanding of just what kind of people populate the border between civilization and hell. I&#x27;m young and I&#x27;d rather learn these lessons from third parties, life is, after all, rather short.<p>It&#x27;s much harder to fudge the results of war than &quot;management&quot; - at the end of most large ones, the territory belongs to someone, and this is recognized by most authorities. So the data quality is better, provided you are careful about collecting it. If you are a manager, you can learn about leadership and how to do extraordinary things with ordinary people, or how to attract extraordinary people; if you are an employee, about which organisations and people to work for or avoid.<p>Is Jack Welch an extraordinary CEO, or was he, as is claimed in Thorndike&#x27;s &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, lucky to start his career with one of the largest economic booms known to man and retire right at the end of it? This impacts whether you&#x27;d like to adopt his methods: is stack ranking a great way to maintain high employee quality and engagement, or does it destroy corporate culture and lead to zombie companies with intense political in-fighting and little output?<p>On the other hand, nobody disputes today that a team of around 150 Selous Scouts and Rhodesian SAS, with no air support, wearing the enemy&#x27;s uniforms and using the same weapons, literally walked into an enemy military base, killed thousands, and walked away without a SINGLE casualty (cf Operation Dingo); and when you dig, you realize this tiny group of men caused 3&#x2F;4 of the enemy casualties in the entire war, many times in similarly one-sided operations, despite not existing before its start and not having any particular technological (the country was under embargo!), numerical or even political advantage. Such a group is worth studying no matter the politics.<p>It&#x27;s also much easier to get several sides to the story: contrast Dick Marcinko&#x27;s own controversial account of creating SEAL Team Six (which by the way has great insights on how to get things done in &quot;big org&quot;) vs Robert Gormley who followed him at the helm of the group and had a more &quot;official&quot; view of the &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot;. Or contrast Col. Charlie Beckwith&#x27;s exceptional account of creating Delta Force, with a first hand, &quot;from the ground&quot; view by Eric Haney, and modern lessons on how it has evolved from Pete Blaber&#x27;s excellent book about &quot;helicopter&quot; management (in this case literally).<p>You can learn about how a large organisation has managed to maintain efficiency and quality through centuries by picking up any of the numerous books on the US Marine Corps - Krulak&#x27;s &quot;First to Fight&quot; and Chesty Puller&#x27;s biographies were my starting point. Did you know Puller read 7 books about Korea on the ship that took him there? He is better known today for simply charging at the enemy in a straight line but like Patton who literally visualized great battles of the classical era to such details he could point at disappeared buildings, he was well read and thoughtful about how to best wage war.<p>What is it like to be &quot;disrupted&quot;? Read it first hand from Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Strange Defeat&quot;, describing just what it was like to face the new, fresh, efficient Wehrmacht when you are led by the last war&#x27;s winners. Sir David Stirling&#x27;s biography reads like a long list of impossible things - from breaking into an Army base to pitch his idea to a few generals, to being responsible for more aircraft losses with his handful of desert-dwelling infantrymen than the entire RAF in the sector. He failed a fair amount, too, including losing most of his men (!) on their first paradrop. And yet he got more budget and more men. Why?<p>You can learn a lot about human nature. Phoenix Program officers say that only 5-20% of a population holds firm views and will act on them; the rest will swing support to whoever controls the territory. How do you tell which is which, and can you turn the 5%? I&#x27;ve found this translates particularly well to analyzing which people you can count on (the famous &quot;who&#x27;d be there when you&#x27;re down&quot;). It is interesting that most veterans will say you don&#x27;t know who will keep a cool head and fire back until the bullets fly; there is little way of telling before then and no discernable pattern, so what does it imply about your interview process?<p>Finally, you can learn the limits of hindsight and analysis. Was COIN (the counterinsurgency doctrine advanced by the Pentagon since Vietnam) a success, as claimed by Chris Martin&#x27;s analysis of open source documents about Delta Force in the 2000s? Or was it the reason American wars are so long and their results so controversial, as claimed by Col. Gian Gentile, because of a misinterpretation of previous successful COIN campaigns? (such as failing to notice that the British won in Malaya by displacing thousands of civilians from the affected areas, thus starving the guerilla)<p>I look at results that exceed expectations, try to draw some names out of it and then look up those names, preferably a first hand account, to understand how they thought and abstract the common traits. It is just amazing the extent to which the military can be a concentrated, more intense version of everyday life, perhaps because the stakes are so much higher.",

The newest ones there are from this month. However, you might be correct to say that it&#x27;s become less known amongst general computer users and programmers, and I think the consumer-oriented nature of computers today (especially mobile devices) is mostly to blame; users are restrained and actively discouraged from tinkering with their machines software and hardware-wise, and isolated from knowledge by many layers of abstraction and complexity. There&#x27;s a big movement against users sharing executables with each other and running them, and while the security concerns are real, I think it&#x27;s also had a chilling effect on the hobbyists. The fact that antimalware software tends to detect packed demos as suspicious&#x2F;infected (false positives) doesn&#x27;t help either. In addition, many people probably found their way into demoscene via the warez scene that it grew from - and with the growing antipiracy concerns, that route is becoming narrower too.<p>While I don&#x27;t think the demoscene is currently &quot;dead&quot; per se, it&#x27;s certainly at risk of becoming even more of an obscure and fringe culture than it is now.",

  "text": "I agree with pron. You wrote &quot;Women are simply less productive, due to exiting the workforce. There is neither distaste nor bias.&quot;<p>The question is, why do they leave the workforce? If it&#x27;s because of a self-reinforcing belief that they less valuable solely because they are women, then it&#x27;s sexist. If such a belief is widespread and entrenched, it means the culture is sexist.<p>Eg, if it&#x27;s because women want to take a year off after the first child, then one interpretation is that it&#x27;s a choice. But the question is, why don&#x27;t the men want to take a year off? Is it due to cultural expectations? Is it that mean get paid more because of a built-in expectation that they will be the ones supporting the family? If so, there&#x27;s a sexist cultural component to the decision.<p>Hence the more feminist cultures have parental leave. Sweden, where I live, has paid leave for both parents, and some of the leave can only be taken by the mother and some only by the father. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the leave is split 50-50. More women take time off than men. One interpretation is that Swedish culture is still sexist. It does bring a smile to my face to see the number of fathers out with their kids, compared to what I&#x27;m used to from the US.<p>Or as another example, consider one of the famous cases of sexual discrimination at work. Quoting from the EEOC, &quot;In Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc., a shipyard company employed a female welder who was continually subjected to nude and partially nude pictures posted by her male co-workers. The men posted these pictures not only in common areas, but also in places where the victim would have to encounter them, including her tool box. The men referred to the victim as &quot;baby,&quot; &quot;sugar,&quot; &quot;momma,&quot; and &quot;dear.&quot; In addition, the men wrote obscene graffiti directed at the victim all over the plant. The men also made numerous suggestive and offensive remarks to the victim concerning her body and the pictures posted on the walls. The victim complained about this atmosphere of harassment on a number of occasions, but the company&#x27;s supervisory personnel provided little or no assistance. The court found this conduct violated Title VII because the plaintiff belonged to a protected category, was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment, the harassment was based on sex, it affected a term or condition of her employment, and the employer knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take remedial action.&quot;<p>If most women exit the workforce in order to avoid harassment caused solely because of their gender, then it&#x27;s due to sexist reasons.<p>Hence why pron and I disagree with your assessment that &quot;Normally the term [sexist] implies some sort of (non-productivity based) distaste for women or bias against believing they will be productive.&quot; The sexual harassment in Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc. had little to do with her being productive or not, but because she was a woman. I have little doubt that being the most productive person in the group would still have resulted in sexist behavior, and in any case if she were not appropriately productive she would not have been promoted to first-class welder.<p>Pron wrote &quot;Sexism is any gender based discrimination that is not 100% provably biologically justified.&quot; Such a definition is in close agreement with the EEOC definition of discrimination on the basis of sex in the workplace. (They aren&#x27;t the same; I assume that &quot;100% provably biologically justified&quot; is for wet nurses and surrogate mothers, while the EEOC allows a wider range of &#x27;bona fide&#x27; reasons to discriminate on the basis of sex, like only hiring men as Chippendale dancers.)<p>Your definition is not, which leads to the strange observation that you must think that some forms of sexual discrimination which are due to the victim&#x27;s gender are not actually sexist.",

This is pure conjecture on my part—I&#x27;m not close to the systemd project or the various distros—so please take it with a grain of salt.<p>Programmers prefer to do less work. Simple tools get the job done and are easy to understand, but often require more effort to use effectively. Using a hand saw, it is hard work to cut a solid piece of wood, but the only servicing it needs is to sharpen the blade. On the other hand, with a chainsaw it is much easier to cut through wood, but there are many more things that you need to care about to keep it running smoothly. When put this way, the hand saw seems superior in its simplicity, but remember that it&#x27;s not immediately obvious that chainsaws can be difficult to start, or that the chains get stuck sometimes. Standing in the hardware store, the chainsaw might seem like the way to go, but one might regret not choosing the simpler option when complications arise later.<p>It seems to me (conjecture, remember) that systemd offers a lot to the distros. It gives them hooks to manage difficult things and, after all, the systemd people are doing all the work. That explains why the distro maintainers might choose it, but my worry is that the convenience comes at a cost.",

Each systems seems to solve it worse than the one before it.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d actually go with forking make, since it&#x27;s the one everyone knows and the most Unix-y, modify it to:<p>* Handle long-running task and task restarts<p>* Handle parallelism<p>* Clean up some of the issues around modularity",

Also note: you will burn yourself many times throughout the build. Might as well do it with a fancy iron!\n    LEADED SOLDER – I started the build without leaded solder and oh dear…\n</code></pre>\nIf you have a &quot;fancy soldering iron&quot;, then lead-free solder shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Also, if you live in the EU, leaded solder will be extremely difficult to come by.<p>Well, even with a really crappy iron, as long as the tip is fresh, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. Most people&#x27;s problems with soldering come from not having the tip wet enough and not using enough solder, thereby not making enough contact with the wire and not putting heat into it fast enough to get that specific location hot before the heat conducts away into the rest of the wire.<p>Remember, the entire reason we&#x27;re using the wire is because it&#x27;s an excellent conductor. For that reason, thicker gauge wire is also going to be more difficult to work. And the only reason to use larger gauges of wire is to support more current. Keyboards run on extremely little current already. You probably could have done this with magnet wire and been fine (though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, magnet wire is difficult to work for different reasons).<p>So if you have a &quot;fancy soldering iron&quot;, crank up the heat. Get it into the wire as fast as possible. Lead-free solder generally needs higher heat than leaded solder anyway. Apply the solder, apply the wire, then wait a second before removing the iron, because you also have to heat the wire you&#x27;re pushing in. Soldering is a chemical bond, the metals physically mix, and you need to get them up to the right heat to do that.<p>And keep it steady, any movement while it is cooling will create microfractures in the solder joint.",

Debian is in general welcoming of downstream distros since the downstream distros—if given proper care and feeding—often feed back useful improvements to Debian.<p>The problem here is that no one is actually doing a fork (yet). Some of the same loud, uninformed minority have just created a ranty web page that presents a skewed view of history and makes threats. It&#x27;s just more of the same but in web page form.<p>Trying to put out and support an entire distribution may serve to broaden their minds as to the delicate position the distribution is in with regard to integrating upstream work into a coherent whole.<p>Sadly I&#x27;m not convinced that any enlightenment is going to be achieved because the people behind this web site admit that they haven&#x27;t even got the time to become involved enough in Debian to have a vote, so I don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re going to find the time to launch a non-toy distribution.",

An onerous documentation change&#x2F;approval management scheme. Covering up a mistake. A culture that causes people to fear losing their jobs, especially for cost reasons, or the feeling that company management are looking for reasons to cut staff. Having your group be blamed for an expensive product recall makes you an easy target. One of the last things a middle-aged engineer in the US auto industry wants to be right now is laid-off.<p>We naively expect a senior engineer to do the ethically correct thing without respect to whether it has negative personal consequences. The problem with this idea is that the consequences for being &quot;that guy&quot; are too great; and both engineering societies and state licensing boards have been derelict in their roles of helping to protect engineers who refuse to do the ethically gray&#x2F;wrong.<p>&gt;I interpret it as the deadline being a root cause.

There is no sexism[pron] but simply &quot;sexism&quot;[1].<p>There is no rhetorical fallacy here, but the mere misuse of the term sexism by you, and it really doesn&#x27;t matter how many people make that mistake. While you bring up murder and puppies as an example, you are simply mistaken in the meaning of the word sexism. You make an analogy to murder -- which implies intent -- while a more proper analogy is killing -- which does not. Killing is bad even if the deaths lack malice. Murder is worse than killing, but only when judgement is concerned. If killing is widespread (as sexism is), people care about stopping it more than passing judgement. The problem with sexism is, that unlike killing, those who are not its victims (and sometimes even its victims) are blind to it (although, to be sure, pointing out sexism often feels like judgment -- just as accusation in indirect killing does).<p>The articles you linked to are irrelevant -- when I say &quot;sexism&quot;, I simply mean sexism (which I&#x27;ve even defined), while you insist on a wrong meaning of a word simply because you feel like it. There is little point in arguing about that.<p>&gt; I do hope to prevent you from imposing your will on those women who behave in ways you disagree with.<p>Ah, this is where things become interesting, and because people here like their science fiction, let&#x27;s talk sci-fi. Did the people living in the Matrix choose to live there or didn&#x27;t know other possibilities existed? Was there liberation coerced or their subjugation, even though the former was quite inconvenience while the latter was as tranquil as slipping into a coma?<p>If society, over millennia, imbues people with an idea that benefits some and harms others, so much so that the oppressed can&#x27;t see their oppression, isn&#x27;t it the moral duty of those who can see outside the matrix to point it out, even if this entails some discomfort? How free is someones choice, if they&#x27;ve been raised to make it? You should know that even during slavery in the US, many slavery supporters claimed that at least some slaves liked their position in society -- which makes sense because they weren&#x27;t exposed to a different reality.<p>Now, you should realize that this isn&#x27;t rhetoric but quite the opposite. It is rhetoric that keeps most of us blind to reality. Once you start seeing how power structures in society work, that they ensure that the powerful stay in power -- even without any conscious, sinister conspiracy behind them, but a constant drip of ideas -- you&#x27;ll feel like physicians must have felt when germs where discovered, and the true nature of many illnesses was finally truly seen.<p>The reason why feminism is so often concerned with words and rhetoric is precisely this. Being forced to actively thing about something so seemingly &quot;natural&quot; as language is a good mechanism of curing our blindness. If you live in the matrix, to see it you must question <i>everything</i> -- the more &quot;innocuous&quot; the better. It&#x27;s so prevalent that it&#x27;s hard to spot unless you try very hard.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sexism</a>",

  "text": "Yeah, previs (pre-visualisation) is generally always done these days, as it lets the director preview what things &quot;look&quot; like, but that only has very basic geometry, low res textures (if any) and no proper cloth&#x2F;skinning deformation animation, and no proper shaders &#x2F; lighting. So it&#x27;s basically using a game engine without even game engine decent lighting &#x2F; shading for the most part.<p>So while it&#x27;s great for placing objects in the scene and getting the camera position correct, that&#x27;s about it. There has been a move to using progressive raytracing more and more over the past year or so, but it&#x27;s still very early days with that.<p>On top of that, as previs is almost always done early (before most asset generation - modelling, texturing, maybe animation too) is done, it doesn&#x27;t always give you all the info you need - i.e. it&#x27;s often the case with mechanical hero objects in the scene (i.e. aircraft, robots, weapons, etc) that the basic geometry used for previs isn&#x27;t good enough, and later on in real lookdev&#x2F;lighting (or sometimes even at animation stage) serious issues are found - i.e. the previs has a robot moving through a street, but when animation actually start trying to rig the robot to get it moving realistically, they find for the arms to swing, it can&#x27;t actually <i>fit</i> in the street.<p>So there&#x27;s a huge amount of iteration that works up-and-down the pipeline, sometimes causing lots of different parts of it to re-do work.<p>Generally it goes:\nPrevis -&gt; Modelling &#x2F; Texturing (linked, as you need UVs) -&gt; Layout -&gt; Animation - &gt; Lookdev &#x2F; Lighting -&gt; Compositing.<p>Any non-trivial change before Lookdev &#x2F; Lighting will trigger new renders having to be done for some layers &#x2F; scenes.",

You&#x27;ll be fighting against your distribution&#x27;s default and the default of every bit of third party software targeted at your distro. From what I have seen most conversions are fairly painless.<p>So from my position that sits somewhere between &quot;ambivalent&quot; and &quot;that&#x27;s kind of nice&quot;, going with the flow seems the easier path.",

Fun and practical.<p>I have been taking Mandarin lessons (eChineseLearning.com) every day for about three months, and am having the time of my life.  I took my fourth business trip to Beijing after only one month of lessons (after self-teaching for about two years), and I was amazed by my ability to interact, and even negotiate prices.  It was huge fun.<p>After only one month, I signed up for their 5-lessons-a-week plan.  I get up at 6 a.m. every day to converse with my teacher in China via Skype.<p>I would definitely suggest one-on-one lessons, as I&#x27;m doing it.  I get maximum reading and discussion time, and the conversation always starts with a description of what I&#x27;ve done over the last day (or over the weekend).  So I&#x27;m learning all sorts of words (e.g., &quot;clients&quot;) that I wouldn&#x27;t get from a regular class.<p>I also know some Spanish and Hebrew.  Hebrew is useful for me since I live in Israel, and Spanish is far easier to pronounce.   But Chinese has been surprisingly easy overall, has helped me with my travels, and give me a big kick.",

We finally got a banking account at CHASE, and we were extremely relieved, thrilled to get a check book that said Make Love Not Porn on it. And so, when... I began encountering enormous problems putting a payments infrastructure into place, because we are what the world deems adult content, we couldn&#x27;t work with PayPal, couldn&#x27;t work with Amazon, couldn&#x27;t work with Google Checkout, couldn&#x27;t work with any of the main merchant partner gateways. So, we thought, let&#x27;s go back to CHASE, we have a business banking account there, let&#x27;s apply for a commercial account. Unfortunately, that application surfaced the nature of our business within higher levels at CHASE. And it resulted in a meeting with a more senior guy, who essentially said to us, not only can we not give you a commercial account, but you now need to close your business bank account and take your business away, because we can&#x27;t handle it.&quot;<p>I had a conversation about this over on Reddit that was fairly interesting.<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2co0r6/anyone_need_a_stripe_or_balancedpayments_but_for/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Entrepreneur&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2co0r6&#x2F;anyone...</a>",

It is so far ahead of the curve (for its use cases) that doing that didn&#x27;t really give any marketing advantage until recently (and I&#x27;m not sure it does now).",

An example of such an argument is the comment along the lines of, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t survive without Mary.  No one else can sell that thing, and it represents 30 percent of our business.&quot;  This statement is often so self-evident that no one thinks to point out the cooperative effort that should be the essence of the organization has already ceased to survive. People come to work, but there is a lack of communication, commitment, and cooperation.  The process of slow death has set in.<p>In one organization, a man of enormous technical competence was allowed to gain a lot of power, and many of his actions poisoned the climate in the workplace.  People around him hated to come to work and went to great lengths to avoid dealing with him.  Their bad feelings, irrationalities, and inefficiencies were costing the organization large but undocumented sums of money. Finally, the situation grew so bad that people united and demanded change. A senior person intervened in this Tyranny of Competence and tried to coach the man. The recipient found the feedback incomprehensible and argued that he was doing his &quot;job&quot; better than anyone else in the place. The organization was simply out to get him for personal and political reasons.<p>Note the accuracy of his argument.  He was doing his &quot;job&quot; well, and the organization was out to get him for political and personal reasons.  The problem was his definition of the word &quot;job&quot;.  His job did not include relating to other people. Organizational relationships, with their interactions and political processes, are as real as physical objects. Not disciplining oneself enough to maintain good relationships is, in fact, destructive behavior.<p>This man eventually left his job, convinced that he had been politically rejected (which was correct) for unjust reasons (which was incorrect).  The day he went down the stairs for the last time, people came out of their offices, held hands, spontaneously danced, and sang, &quot;Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead!&quot;  They discovered that this irreplaceable person was indeed replaceable.  The top executives marveled at the increase in overall performance.  They vowed not to make the same mistake again.",

The cognitive advantages are so extensive because according to a school of thought (Chomsky and Pinker) language itself is part of our human nature, it&#x27;s innate, and is a product of biological evolution of our human brain. Knowing and switching between different languages on the fly requires a lot cognitive focus but if practiced enough, it becomes second nature, even better if languages were learned while still very young. I grew up speaking three languages (Mandarin, Portuguese, and English) and I do see the cognitive benefits when I&#x27;m programming daily in 2-4 different languages (Scala, JS, Python, PHP for instance). I don&#x27;t confuse language features from one language with the other while I see co-workers mess up from time to time.",

If you remove the external drive, all your files will get deleted from Dropbox. Also, you need to restart Dropbox if you make changes to the folders on the external drive. Otherwise, they won&#x27;t be synced.<p>I talked to my twin brother about this and he suggested building an app for that. Having a background in Windows internals we decided to go ahead and build it. We wanted to solve that in an elegant and effortless way, something even our parents (who are not tech savvy) could use.<p>So here is Boxifier, a Windows app which installs on top of Dropbox and lets you right click any folder and sync it to Dropbox.<p>I would really appreciate any feedback you might have.\nThanks,\nRazvan",

  "text": "These are just easy to understand examples. I don&#x27;t know any Rubyists who would actually define these methods in exactly this way. If you look at the Ruby StdLib, you&#x27;ll see that, most of the time, libraries implement operators in a way that is consistent with the spirit of canonical methods. For example, in Unix, a network socket is abstracted in a way that is similar to a file. You read&#x2F;write from it in similar ways. This is an abstraction pattern. Ruby also has patterns. Lots of them, actually.<p>For example, many Ruby objects accept a block. The ampersand unary operator is used in a particularly common pattern that interacts with methods where a block would normally be passed.<p>Imagine you have an object that is implemented as a collection of items; like a collection of query results, wrapped in an object. Let&#x27;s also imagine you want to call a method on each of the items. In Ruby there are two simple ways to do this. The example below uses an Array, upon which many common patterns are based [1].<p>1) Using a simple map function, which passes the receiver as an argument to a block:<p><pre><code>  [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;WORLD!&quot;].map { |x| x.downcase }\n  #=&gt; [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;] \n</code></pre>\n2) Using the unary operator of the Symbol class to pass a proc:<p><pre><code>  [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;WORLD&quot;].map(&amp;:downcase)\n  #=&gt; [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world!&quot;]\n</code></pre>\nThe second example uses a pattern combining #map from Array and #to_proc from Symbol. This looks like magic the first time you see it, but it&#x27;s actually pretty simple to follow when you look at the two examples side by side.<p>Ref:<p><a href=\"http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Array.html#method-i-map\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ruby-doc.org&#x2F;core-2.1.3&#x2F;Array.html#method-i-map</a><p><a href=\"http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Symbol.html#method-i-to_proc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ruby-doc.org&#x2F;core-2.1.3&#x2F;Symbol.html#method-i-to_p...</a><p>The article linked in the submission is definitely worth a look.

  "text": "&gt; It&#x27;s secure because it was designed from the ground up to be secure at an implementation level, and (critically) to be misuse-resistant.<p>Ok, interesting. Do you happen to have an example at hand? I don&#x27;t see where there is room left for much sophistication in the implementation (regarding misuse-resistance), between the well defined algorithms and the strict API that Sodium shares with NaCl. For example lets look at crypto_box (public-key authenticated encryption):<p>On the crypto side it uses Curve25519 (alias X25519). Its paper has a pretty clear definition how to use the public key bytes as an x-coordinate. Because of the Montgomery multiplication an implementation does not have to calculate the y-coordinate, this eliminates one potential error source. Because of (1) its twist security and because (2) any input in a small subgroup results in a zero element output (neutral element or the (0,0) point), an implementation does not have to check the public key for its validity (another error source eliminated). All these are benefits any implementation will have.<p>On the interface side crypto_box is as locked down as a nonce based design can be: You enter &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;any 32 byte public key value (X25519 makes sure no harm can be done with malicious values),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt; &lt;li&gt;your 32 bytes private key (not malleable by the attacker),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt; the nonce (during decryption any input is ok, because a wrong input will just generate an authentication error; during encryption there is the danger of nonce reuse, which is also present in NaCl) and &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the plaintext &#x2F; crypttext (again, because of the mandatory authentication any malicious ciphertext input will be rejected by the library).&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;<p>So I don&#x27;t see how a faithful implementation of the interface and algorithm specifications can get much wrong regarding misuse-resistance. Regarding it being secure because it was designed from the ground up to be secure at an implementation level, that is something I expect from any cryptography library. After all, is there any more basic requirement than that? (Well, you could argue being interoperable with other implementations is the most fundamental requirement, but I won&#x27;t accept such low expectations when I&#x27;m asking for a competent developer.)<p>&gt; It gets what trustworthiness it has from the fact that it&#x27;s a slavish fork of Nacl that merely aims to make it compatible with more runtimes.<p>I fully agree that its inheritance from NaCl is Sodiums strongest selling point and its the argument I should have been using instead. I only had it dimly in the back of my heat at that time, though, and wasn&#x27;t sure enough about it to claim it as a fact. Being less lazy to look it up would have saved me this follow up post ;) (Though I am genuinely interested in my question above.)",

As others have described, the consumer behavior of an international traveler is that they are willing to pay more, so why not charge them?<p>2. Badly set foreign exchange rates. Companies that sell internationally will use an exchange rate internally when setting prices in a foreign currency that are typically <i>very</i> beneficial to themselves. Sometimes this represents the inherent risk in doing business in a foreign currency. Other times, it is used as a dumping tactic so they can claim they set their prices by simple conversion (Strauss Israel, for example, uses an internal rate of 4.8, which the shekel has never reached in all of history).<p>The former is the reason why flights in Brazil, Thailand are expensive when purchasing abroad. The latter is the reason why Malaysian or Columbian flights are expensive. Better advice is to simply know that most credit cards (both US and european) automatically convert charges, and you&#x27;ll get a much better rate (typically 1-2% commission on the forex rate of the bill date) by finding a way to make the purchase in the foreign currency, rather than USD or EUR.",

To be really honest I think TripHobo.com does not fit SomeCallMeTim&#x27;s use case. I think Roadtrippers.com may fit the bill. Having said that, I am a big fan of TripHobo.com. I have seen the portal evolve for sometime and I see it as the closest solution to fixing travel planning \nI have my reasons here:\n1) The only source which gives you draft itineraries created by other users. This is immensely useful as i can see what other are planning to my destination. I planned a trip to Rome using TripHobo.com and i find it immensely useful.. \n2) If you hit Plan my trip button, the TripPlanning functionality is awesome. You can add almost all attractions  in a city to your trip plan and you can hit the optimize button, you get an automated route planned. What TripHobo claims is that the route plans generated are not only optimized for distance but also for opening and closing times of attractions. I think this is really cool.\nNo one does it so easily.. not even google!  \n3) The ease of usage: This is the most easy to use portal for trip planning.<p>Limitations: \nI think there is only one limitation as SomeCallMeTim pointed out..\nLimited number of cities .. I counted the number of cities manually in August last year, i could find 171 cities to which i could plan trips to. I counted again on 5th october 2014 and i found that there were 243 cities. Today i saw that they have changed their interface to a search bar and hence I am not able to determine how many cities are enabled on Triphobo.com.. If they go on increasing the number of cities to which one can plan his&#x2F;her trip to say 3000-4000 cities around the world.. i think TripHobo.com will have fixed travel planning for sure. My 2 cents!<p>I am also tracking folks like roadtrippers, mygola and tripomatic. To me these (along with TripHobo) are the leading 4 travel planning players today. MyGola has been a disappointment..Tripomatic is difficult to use..Roadtrippers and TripHobo are i think getting some serious traction .. Roadtrippers has primary focus on roadtrips whereas TripHobo is a holistic leisure travel solution if they are able to scale their content..",

If I could learn everything by watching videos and listening to lectures then there are already thousands of high quality documentaries, TTC courses and so on. The thing is that we humans don&#x27;t learn subjects deeply just by watching bunch of videos but only by actually doing things.<p>For instance, there are probably 100s of videos and lectures on General Relativity out there. You can watch them endlessly and you would have some understanding of overall ideas but you would be at complete loss if someone takes simple exercise problems from any textbook and asks you to solve it. In other words, deep understanding doesn&#x27;t happen simply by watching phenomenal documentaries.<p>Major component that really matters of any academic programs is homework and exercises. These is what allows students to get deep insights in to subject and make sure they can actually put their learning in to action. It also allows professors to verify that they have actually crossed the line from shallow understanding to deep understanding. This is what you pay for when you go to college. No amount of video lectures by James Cameron is going to replace this.",

I guess I cannot speak for the all the rural regions where learning just the local dialect of the state language would suffice but education in most tier-2 and metro cities is carried out in English in most places  and everybody knows it is the language they must learn if they are to enter the global marketplace at any point in their lives. Not everyone is equally fluent but they tend to know just about enough to communicate.\nIn North India, the most prevalent language is Hindi. And several of the other state languages are often related in some way to Hindi making them at least partially mutually intelligible. Like Punjabi and Marathi.\nSouth India is a whole other matter. The four predominant languages there are quite different from the Northern ones. Some of them share different forms of similar words but each has its own script.\nHaving spent varying amounts of time growing up in Delhi, Madras, Madurai and Bangalore, I can speak, read and write in Hindi, Tamil and English. My fluency in each of these areas tends to vary but I can get by in any one of these alone. Also, through my interactions with friends and neighbours, I can understand bits and pieces of few other languages as well",
