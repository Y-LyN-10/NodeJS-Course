We are a new crowdfunding platform with a twist - we let you partner with retail businesses by financing their inventory, helping them with marketing&#x2F;lead generation and then collecting a return when that inventory sells. What I am personally really excited about, is that because the users are actively engaged throughout the process, this type of investment is not classified as a security an we can offer it to non-accredited investors. It&#x27;s also a pretty unique solution for the businesses as they essentially get their inventory fronted to them at no cost, freeing up their cash for other business activities. Would love any feedback on anything, our site is: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickfurther.com",
