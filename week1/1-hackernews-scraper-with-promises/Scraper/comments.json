I would also guess that the same issue was considered at NASA while planning the Mars Exploration Rover (solar) and Curiosity (RTG) missions. Are you claiming that this did not factor into their decision at all?",

Glass doesn&#x27;t have the CPU power to do it, so you&#x27;d have to rely on cloud power; do you really think everybody wants all their key strokes sent to Google? And language models aren&#x27;t that much help with terminal commands. And even humans can&#x27;t do this; you&#x27;re expecting Glass to be smarter than a human... not impossible, but think about what processing power and memory it has on board, both constrained by battery.
