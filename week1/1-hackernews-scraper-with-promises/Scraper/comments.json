In addition most of the public doesn&#x27;t even know or is interested in the technical details of a mission like this.

  "text": "Linear algebra - I wouldn&#x27;t say so. Vectorization - yes, to a certain extent; whenever you&#x27;d have a loop, you have to remind your self that it&#x27;s implicit - and that forces you to think about the collection as a whole instead of a single element of the collection. Sometimes there is apparently no collection to begin with. That, in turn, makes you think why - is it actually correct, do you have a good design?<p>In J it&#x27;s much more natural to load a whole dataset into memory and then work with it as a whole. To make it easier, you&#x27;re strongly nudged to design your data structure simply and uniformly. Thinking about clarity of data structures has many advantages - e.g., clearly seeing the algorithm as a whole, being able to pinpoint (and question) exceptions, optimize on the high(est) level...<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean J can&#x27;t do sequential processing - but if you choose that, you want to understand why: is it the nature of the problem or is it a (questionable) implementation detail?<p>Some start learning J by using it as a calculator. Indeed, what could be easier in the beginning - typing 2 + 2 &lt;Enter&gt; produces expected result, same for 3 * 4 and 5 - 1, then you have built-in exponent (^3 produces 20.0855), logarithm (^. 20.0855 - kinda easy to remember, an inverse function), factorial (!6 makes 720)... Gradually it becomes less conventional - order of operations is always right-to-left (as in sqrt(sqrt(sqrt 2))) - that would be %: %: %: 2), negative numbers look like _1, _2, _3, sine and cosine are in the family of o. functions - 1 o. 1.5 gives 0.997495, 2 o. is 0.0707372 - and you&#x27;re also allowed something like 5 + 1 2 3 which returns 6 7 8. A few more iterations - and you can use moderately complex expressions with infix notation, typing quite economically. Then vectorization gradually grows in more complex expressions...",

I see no reason for not doing this if you&#x27;re a professional programmer. Language design and implementation is a thing that you&#x27;ll interact with every day working as a programmer. It really makes no sense not to have at least basic grasp of it.",

It took him seven years and $12 million.</i><p>Ok, I haven&#x27;t seen Mannheimer&#x27;s place, but something that matches this description just opened up across the street from me in Bushwick, Brooklyn. I guarantee that the hipsters who opened it didn&#x27;t have a budget greater than $12 million, and nobody was thinking about this neighborhood more than a few years ago.<p>In other words, while New York can be a hard place, things still happen here, artists still live here and produce amazing work, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine there&#x27;s a better place for performing artists to work anywhere in the US. For some reason, there has been a move recently to declare the big coastal cities impossible to live in, yet they remain great places to live, which is why so many people want to live here.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re going to start a company and have an extremely limited budget, by all means do it somewhere other than NYC or SV. Artists need an audience. A tech company just needs an internet connection.<p>Edit: also, I want to address this quote: &quot;In the world of hipsters, is there anything more ironic than coming to live in Des Moines, as opposed to living in Brooklyn?&quot;<p>Anyone still talking about irony with regards to hipsters clearly has no idea what the kids in Bushwick are doing.

  "text": "Additional tips from someone who failed:<p>1) Buy a used cast-iron off ebay. The old cast irons were machined smoother. Anything you buy new from lodge today is going to have a texture like low grit sand paper. Any old Wagner or Griswold is going to have a much smoother base surface.<p>2) Make sure you get everything off your pan. If you did buy a new pan, they often have weird artificial seasoning on them. If you have an old pan, anything loose can provide a failure mode for your new nice coat of seasoning.<p>3) Don&#x27;t get 100% of the oil off between coats as the article suggests. You won&#x27;t build any seasoning.<p>4) Consider using Canola oil. The flaxseed oil that you buy seems to have some particulate matter that is noticeable in the finished seasoning. That or I didn&#x27;t shake mine enough.<p>5) Consider doing this at a time when you can open all the doors&#x2F;windows. Even if you stick to the really thin layer, your house will still get a smelly smoke.<p>6) Don&#x27;t leave anything nice on the top of your stove. My oven vents out over the burners, and a Le Cruset pot resting there got covered in a sticky residue that was a pain to clean off.<p>More background:<p>I tried this with a beat up hand-me-down wagner about a year ago. I did six coats of flaxseed while following the instructions to &quot;get all the oil off&quot; with a towel after each application. The result was a pan with basically no seasoning that everything stuck to.<p>I went back and repeated while leaving a thicker layer (still not oil pooled or anything, but noticeably wet&#x2F;shiny). This worked much better, and left a decent coat on the pan that things don&#x27;t stick to. Sadly I did not strip the pan back down after the first misadventure, and some of my nice seasoning is now peeling around the corners.",

  "text": "&gt; Not only do some ports take a long time to compile (like Firefox) but a little too often won&#x27;t compile--maddening when that happens 2 hours after entering &quot;make&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve only once tried using FreeBSD for a desktop machine, and lengthy compilation times (followed by the occasional failure) were one of the reasons I didn&#x27;t, and another one of the reasons why I eventually dumped Gentoo as my choice for workstations. I remember building Xorg overnight once on Gentoo only to discover that it had failed about 30 minutes <i>after</i> I went to bed.<p>I&#x27;m still a little upset over that, thinking back on it.<p>&gt; (Don&#x27;t know enough about Arch to comment on it.) On the whole pkg is pretty painless.<p>Arch is a rolling release distribution with binary packages; it seems that pkg operates in a manner similar (identical?) to this. It really is the best of both worlds: New packages, when updates are released upstream--usually within days--without the need to compile.<p>Though, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Arch for much other than a workstation (partially due to the nature of rolling releases--breakage happens), it has actually been a fantastic distro for someone whose <i>nix history went something like OpenBSD -&gt; FreeBSD -&gt; Gentoo. You update the system periodically, new packages are downloaded and installed, and updates occur frequently. Compilation is mostly limited to the AUR (Arch User Repository), but the benefit with Arch is that its build tools create binary packages by default that you can then use on other machines of the same architecture. Gentoo allows the same thing, but IIRC it&#x27;s not something it&#x27;ll do by default and it&#x27;s a bit fussier. If you do have to build something, Arch will build the package first, then install from that. But the main repositories have essentially everything you&#x27;d want, so compilation truly is limited to less popular&#x2F;common packages. Everything else is just a download + install away.<p>But again, Arch is susceptible to some breakage at times, although I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck avoiding this. I guess it&#x27;s like anything else: If you&#x27;re careful and apply some meticulous scrutiny to the process, you&#x27;re less likely to break things in a manner that&#x27;s difficult to fix. Updating regularly (as with other rolling releases, like Gentoo) is also helpful. Too long between updates can create a bit of a difficult situation to get out of.<p>&gt; Yes and no. I installed openjdk 8.x the other day using &#x27;pkg search&#x27;, then &#x27;pkg install&#x27;. Quite simple. However, if for some reason the Oracle version is necessary, then you&#x27;d have the hassle of getting it from their site.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s not too bad. I </i>vaguely* recall it being painful back during 5.x-6.x, but I never had much need for Java on FreeBSD either outside some odds and ends.<p>&gt; Maybe I should feel a little embarrassed that I still have one DB server which has been running FBSD 6.0 since 2005 (I think).<p>NOPE! (I wouldn&#x27;t.)<p>When I ran FreeBSD (all the way back through the latter 4.x days, probably 4.5-4.6 at the absolute earliest, but I think we had a 4.7&#x2F;4.8 machine running for a number of years), the <i>beautiful</i> thing about it was <i>definitely</i> its stability. You could do exactly that: Go for ages without updating it and as long as it wasn&#x27;t Internet-connected, there wasn&#x27;t really much you needed to worry about. And even if it was, you could just update whatever software you had listening on open ports, within reason, and not worry (I&#x27;d do this with Apache or BIND). I know this goes counter to much of the philosophy here, but sometimes if it ain&#x27;t broke...<p>The curious thing regarding FreeBSD was the more conservative upgrade path you&#x27;d often feel compelled to take, and you seldom felt guilty for leaving a machine untouched. You could always take comfort in the fact that it&#x27;d Just Work and remain fairly secure.",

Keeping it covered is key to minimizing the stinky house problem.<p>Maybe if I followed the article I wouldn&#x27;t have to do that, but it&#x27;s just not that hard now that I have the habit and I really like the cooking characteristics of cast iron (how well it holds heat, etc.) so I&#x27;m going to stick with it (pun intended ^_^ )",

  "text": "Yes (to both--new usually calls malloc), but the degree to which depends on the platform. In the old days, there was a single lock around the allocator serializing malloc&#x2F;free. These days, all the major platforms have a memory allocator that tolerates some degree of concurrency, and you can also link in tcmalloc or jemalloc. Even then, a lot will depend on your allocation patterns. For example, many threaded malloc implementations depend on thread-local caches to avoid having to take a lock on the fast path. This works great for many workloads, but can also fall flat on others. Consider what happens when a producer thread allocates memory, passes a pointer to a consumer thread which frees it. The thread-local cache in the producer thread will never be replenished by free() calls, and the thread-local cache in the consumer thread will never be used by malloc() calls. Thus performance can become very dependent on the mechanism the allocator uses to transfer memory to&#x2F;from the local caches and the global heap.",

  "text": "The interviewer was trying to figure out why the subdivision process doesn&#x27;t turn everything into a blob -- which is understandable, given that the examples he was shown were squares turning into circles and cubes turning into spheres.  I think he&#x27;s trying to understand why, for example, Geri&#x27;s head doesn&#x27;t turn into a sphere.<p>DeRose doesn&#x27;t say so explicitly, but the reason is that the position of any given point on the infinitely subdivided surface is only determined by the positions of a handful of points in the control mesh.  That&#x27;s why, for example, the derivation for the final position of B given at the end of the video only depends on its neighbors A and C, and not any other points.<p>Thus, if you want more control over a portion of a subdivision surface, you can just use a denser control mesh in that portion of the model.  You can create arbitrarily hard edges by moving control vertices closer together.  At a microscopic scale, the edge is still smooth and blobby, but it looks sharp at a distance.<p>You can also make creases in subdivision surfaces by using different subdivision weights over the surface of the model, which may be what DeRose is getting at when he answers with &quot;magic numbers&quot;.  But it&#x27;s my understanding that most modern CG is done using subdivision with the standard Catmull-Clark weights over the entire model, instead relying on the density of the input mesh to specify detail.",

After I bought it used, I cleaned off the gunk, rust spots, and dust bunnies with soap, water and steel wool. I dried it over the burner, and wiped it with some oil. I wiped away the excess oil, and that was it. No oven-baked seasoning process.<p>To clean after cooking, I usually just wipe it out. Every now and then I do a more thorough cleaning, essentially repeating what I did when I first bought it. Wash with soap, scraping with a spatula to get stuck bits off. Dry it over the flame, and wipe on a thin layer of oil, and wipe off the excess. When I&#x27;m done, I can sometimes see a dull reflection of myself in the bottom of the pan. It is quite smooth.<p>I have cooked with citrus, tomatoes, vinegar, alcohol, etcetera. It is not &quot;non-stick&quot; enough to cook eggs or fish without oil, and usually those foods necessitate washing. I have never had to do a bake-on seasoning process. I have never started a smoky grease fire with it.<p>More high-maintenance than a stainless pan, certainly, but I like the cooking characteristics. I like that I can scrape hard with a metal spatula to release food after searing. I like that it reacts to temperature changes more gradually. I like that it heats with a significant temperature differential. I like going from stove top, to oven, to broiler, to grill, to wood fire without damaging the pan.",

Basecamp makes more money each year than most startups ever will and they&#x27;re entirely remote. I love in the south of France and work just fine without having to go to company HQ in New York. The only folks working in the office are just the sales guys and even they could do their work just fine from home if they were so inclined. Location is only relevant if you need an address to impress a particularly unelightened investor. The myth that the talent is only in San Fran or NYC is getting played out. I have several devs that work for me that live in Portland, Jacksonville, Atlanta, Belgrade-- folks all over the place and they&#x27;re &quot;top tier&quot; talent. In fact I would argue that it&#x27;s harder to recruit talent in NYC and San Fran.. Real wages are comparatively lower than pretty much anywhere else in the country and you&#x27;re competing against places like Google, Twitter, Apple. Why would a Dev come work for your (figuratively) rinky-dink startup for likely less money and likely worthless equity (statistically speaking) when they could walk down the street and work for any number of successful companies? However if I lived in a place like Grand Rapids, your startup might be an attractive choice.. And it would even save you money: you can pay the same salary but you&#x27;d pay less for their health insurance and you could save on the extra office space. You could also save on the silliness like a &quot;beer fridge&quot; or whatever else is the latest trend in an attempt to be a great place to work.<p>My criteria for a great place to work: competent product managers, an interesting product, a good salary, equity that isn&#x27;t insulting, proper vacation time and other folks working with me that value high quality code. That&#x27;s pretty much it. Your awesome office space is a waste of money and doesn&#x27;t attract &quot;good&quot; developers -- a good dev is not going to sign up with you because of office space; those other elements must be there. Anyone that places a value of the office space over the value of those other things is an idiot. When I did work in an office in New York, I enjoyed my time the most with a company that had no windows, was in a cramped, shared space with barely enough room for a laptop, let alone a massive desk for my 27&quot; monitor much more than the hip place with great coffee, a ping ping table and catered lunches because of the work we were doing and the people I had to work with.<p>Talent should be location irrelevant for an Internet company. Actually, unless you have a warehouse or must meet customers in person or sell retail (or build a physical product,) the entire concept of an &quot;office&quot; is about as relevant as a VCR.",

  "text": "Lets go back and look at the history of human knowledge about comets for a moment.<p>1) The composition of comets were largely unknown until ~1950 when Fred Whipple hypothesized that they were largely icy objects instead of rocky objects, which was only confirmed in 1986 when Vega 1 and 2 flew by Halley&#x27;s comet.<p>2) This idea was flipped in 2001 when Deep Space 1 took photos of the comet Borrelly, which showed a hot and dark surface.<p>3) The Stardust mission in 2004 discovered that the dust of a comet was actually a crystalline structure, created by very high temperatures.<p>4) The Deep Impact probe in 2005 was the first physical contact humans had with a comet&#x27;s surface, which resulted in us combining the two previous hypotheses into an object filled with an icy dust mixture protected by a hard and hot dirt shell.<p>5) Finally this year we landed Philae onto a comet&#x27;s surface by launching a probe in 2004, a mission that started as far back as 1992.<p>This means that we were planning on landing an object onto the surface of a comet long before we knew what in the hell a comet really was. To say that we failed to meet the goal of a one week operational timeframe on the surface disregards the entirety of knowledge learned during the operation of the mission in which we were conducting. Just after Rosetta launched we figured out that the surface of a comet was probably more ice than rock, and had to conduct retroactive experiments in order to determine whether or not the harpoons of which had already been engineered, designed, manufactured and launched into space (which failed to work, so the result is somewhat moot anyways) would in fact be capable of holding the lander on the surface of the comet. The main goal of this mission was to learn more about comets, not spend a defined time on the surface like a game of &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; at some elementary school playground. The mission was successful. We obtained data about the surface of comets and discoveries and observations resulting from the collection of this data will continue to happen over many years to come. Would have it been better if we were able to keep a probe operational on the surface of the comet for years instead of weeks, or weeks instead of days? Yes. But the goal was to learn shit, not get in a pissing contest with a nonexistent alternative lifeform that has already landed an object on a comet and kept it alive longer than us.",

We are about a 2 hour drive from Des Moines and there is a lot of collaboration happening across the state outside of just Des Moines.<p>There is huge growth happening in the tech sector within Iowa, but also in other areas, education, medical, insurance, agri-business, being a few of the key areas.<p>I&#x27;ve seen mention on here already of RAGBRAI and the bike friendliness of Des Moines; this is more true in the Iowa City&#x2F;Coralville areas, and equally true in the main Cedar Rapids districts.<p>Here are some things that are more interesting though; the midwest has some of the lowest in the nation, and Iowa sits at an average unemployment rate of 4.5%.  In terms of diversity; it may not have been that diverse 20 years ago, but these days Iowa is ranked as the 3rd most progressive state, right behind Massachusetts and California.<p>We have huge incentives for technology, start-up accelerators, local tech conferences, low cost of living, local re-investment. Personally, I hate the &quot;Silicon Prairie&quot; term, because it means that people turn it into a us vs them sort of comparison.  In terms of raw numbers, more successful start-ups are going to come out of California; or I would certainly hope so since the population of the state is in excess of 38M whereas as Iowa is just barely over 3M.  However in terms of your chances of success; these days I think the odds are probably in your favor in Iowa.<p>I&#x27;m just some dude, and I&#x27;ve had beers, dinner, or just visited with CEOs of many of the tech businesses (long established &amp; start-ups) and the thing is these are great people.  They still relate to their humble beginnings and they want to give back and grow business right here.  They are so approachable, and I think this is in large part due to the fact that the lines aren&#x27;t as long because we are still small.<p>Right now I seriously have to give a shout-out to Eric Engelmann, founder of the Iowa Startup Accelerator and the CEO of Geonetric.  He is an all around great guy, who has done so much for this area and continues to do so, and there are too many more around here to name.<p>Is it Hipster? Some yes, some no. Is it a great place to be right now? Unequivocally; Yes. But you don&#x27;t have to join us; we&#x27;ll continue to do just fine on our own. If you do though; you just might fall in love.<p>To end with; here&#x27;s some links to a few things that are happening in Iowa<p><a href=\"http://www.iowastartupaccelerator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iowastartupaccelerator.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"http://uipartners.uiowa.edu/deviowa\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uipartners.uiowa.edu&#x2F;deviowa</a><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6uYhe4TzHsCNjNWVlhDMXAwVFE/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;0B6uYhe4TzHsCNjNWVlhDMXAwVFE...</a> (Mapping Venture Capital In Iowa)<p><a href=\"http://www.welchavenue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.welchavenue.com&#x2F;</a> (Iowa only start-up news)<p><a href=\"http://siliconprairienews.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconprairienews.com&#x2F;</a> (Midwest start-up news)",

No one there due to having a low socio-economic status wants to live there but they can&#x27;t afford other places that would give them the same access to work (and even leisure). Location-wise, it&#x27;s extremely practical to live in a favela (and it&#x27;s interesting that in California, for example, the rich people generally live on the hills, whereas that&#x27;s not the case in Rio).<p>There are several prime cases of favela removal in Rio (Pinto, Catacumba, Esqueleto) in and around the 1960s and 70s. The residents were removed to City of God, and some run-down areas near the international airport (Complexo do Maré, etc). Also, in the first few years of the 20th century, there was a large mandate to destroy and remove favelas in downtown Rio (called the &quot;bota-abaixo&quot;) which did beautify these areas, allowed for sanitary services to be installed, etc. Most of these residents just moved to other places like Rocinha and Vidigal on the other side of the city. So, even if they&#x27;re &quot;removed&quot;, they end up equally poor in a less desirable (to them) location in the same city.<p>At this point, as it has been for a long time, favelas are just part of Brazilian life and they&#x27;ve grown to have their own culture, social norms, vocabulary, etc. So, if favelas are to be done away with, it will have to be done with sufficient resources, extreme care and to the liking (can&#x27;t think of a better word) of the residents themselves.<p>While they live in favelas, they want dignity, respect, and access to basic services (ex, Rocinha has an open sewer at the bottom of the hill). So these things will have to exist where they end up living, and during the transfer process.",

  "text": "I&#x27;ll take a shot at your line width question. When you are dragging across the canvas slowly, you get sent an event for every pixel the mouse touches, and your code is drawing a 20px wide line between each new point. If the pixel is down from the last pixel, it will draw a 1px by 20px horizontal line. If it&#x27;s the to right it will draw a 1x20px vertical line, because it&#x27;s just trying to connect the last point to the new point. If the next mouse event happens to be perfectly diagonal from the last, it will draw a 20px wide line that&#x27;s diagonal. Since the mouse is moving pixel by pixel, if you drag it diagonally, it&#x27;s path will basically randomly be one of these three movements, so you get a mixture of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines. Notice that if you move the mouse quickly enough, you don&#x27;t get an event for every pixel along the path (since the resolution of the mouse&#x27;s motion isn&#x27;t high enough), and it will draw a clean 20px line between each detected point.<p>What I would do to handle this is when you are drawing fat lines, draw a 20px diameter filled circle at the beginning point, then the line to the ending point, then a 20px diameter circle at the end point. This will give you strokes with rounded ends. Another possible improvement along this lines is that you could paint a  circle when someone first clicks on the canvas rather than only when they move the mouse.",

Hopefully this helps answer your question.<p>You asked why it doesn&#x27;t have a positioning system: the simple answer is the battery (Philae has only 130Wh or so), cost and whether it&#x27;s necessary to do the science: it wasn&#x27;t.<p>If you measure distance by timing light, you&#x27;re using a LIDAR system by definition.  A laser isn&#x27;t explicitly necessary, but because the power received is proportional to R^-4, using an isotropic emitter is wasteful.  A pulsed LIDAR system with cm accuracy over 20km is doable, you&#x27;d need to time the light to within around 30ns.  However we&#x27;d struggle to get that kind of accuracy on Earth, let alone orbiting a comet.<p>Luminosity isn&#x27;t good enough to measure distance (certainly not cm level), it depends on the efficiency of the emitter and the efficiency of the detector, both of which might have changed during flight. It also depends on the transmission medium, in this case it may well be dusty.  It could potentially give you a location, but I&#x27;m sceptical Rosetta would see it above the background unless it was an extremely bright source.  I think putting the transmitter on the lander would be the backward route.<p>A corner cube reflector would probably be the most viable solution.  We&#x27;re assuming that Rosetta can overfly Philae and fire its laser in the right place, but I think that would ok.  LOLA on the Lunar Recon. Orbiter flew as low as 30km and only got down to around 10cm resolution and required around 15-30W.<p>My comment regarding GPS was that many people assume that you can get a 3D fix on an object with a single recieve&#x2F;transmit pair (like in the movies) and it simply doesn&#x27;t work like that.  A directional antenna could work, perhaps.",

Well, the number of families of eigenvectors; the number of colours. By noticing that they&#x27;re orthogonal to each other, you can imagine that if we were in three dimensions, there&#x27;d be a third one, orthogonal to the other two.<p>The number of eigenvalues is pretty obvious from the maths (the characteristic eqn will always have a lambda^n in it), but that there&#x27;s the reason graphically.

I was motivated by my Compilers course and a minimal Java compiler we developed targeting MIPS to start a project creating my own language.<p>Much of my experience with programming languages has been with interpreted or scripted languages. I find that they have a really low barrier to entry. But ideally Duck would have its own binary compiler and other tools. It&#x27;s just that right now, in the language forming stage, it makes sense to formalize all aspects of the programming language first. In the future, it might be the case that Duck has significantly better performance than Lua or Python, but I can&#x27;t really tell at the moment, especially without some tweaks to the language that move it towards static&#x2F;strongly typed code. This is just the nature of reality.<p>So yes, it&#x27;s mainly a toy language at this stage, but I would like to see it optimally used as a game language.

  "text": "It&#x27;s actually unknown whether there&#x27;s an atmosphere there. Temperature in space is very cold, sure, but if there are no gas collisions nothing carries the heat away (like, say, on Antarctica). So the lander would only really be cold where it touches the comet, and the comet actually gets quite hot at times. Wikipedia mentions that Haley&#x27;s comet was 70 degrees celcius (above zero) last time it passed by Earth.<p>Despite geostationary satellites operating in an environment that&#x27;s nominally -265 or so degrees celcius, the problem they usually experience is overheating, not freezing. Blackbody radiation will eventually carry the heat away, but we&#x27;re talking decades to get to -100 or so.<p>For instance, a human body at rest generates about 150 watts of power, which would kill you in geostationary orbit without a cooling system. It would kill you because it wouldn&#x27;t take long for your body temperature to rise to 52 degrees, at which point your cell metabolism abruptly stops (your mitochondria will stop generating energy). It would take longer than it takes you to choke though. Though nobody&#x27;s ever tried for obvious reasons, you should be able to exit a space station and get back in with just a helmet that protects your mouth and nose and ears from decompression. You wouldn&#x27;t freeze, you wouldn&#x27;t explode. You&#x27;d overheat in 10-15 minutes or so. If you survive that, you&#x27;d die 2 weeks later from radiation poisoning. On the moon you need heating, because it actually has an atmosphere that would carry heat away.<p>It is fun reminiscing about just how special our place in the universe is. Human bodies wouldn&#x27;t be able to survive on planets 30% closer to the Sun, or about 15% farther away. We wouldn&#x27;t be alive without a mostly oxygen atmosphere, because without the ozone layer, solar radiation would kill us. Without the earth magnetic field, solar radiation would kill us. Without the sun protecting us from interstellar radiation, we&#x27;d die. If our solar system was further to the outside of the milky way, we wouldn&#x27;t survive the radiation, solar protection or not. If it was closer to the middle, we wouldn&#x27;t survive. It&#x27;s unknown whether it&#x27;s a black hole at the center or something else, but it sure outputs a lot of radiation. Oh, and we&#x27;re in the &lt; 0.1% of the milky way that hasn&#x27;t experienced a supernova explosion for about 3 billion years (a supernova explosion at 20 lightyears or less would kill all life on earth. 50 lightyears is considered the minimum safe distance for large mammals to survive). The milky way has collided with at least 3 other (tiny) galaxies, none of the collissions were (are) anywhere near us, as the tidal stresses would alter planetary orbits, and so on and so forth.<p>All of this is ignoring the physical necessities for life to exist. If the fine structure constant, for instance, was 0.1% bigger or smaller, there would be no chemistry, and no humans. If the speed of light was ~5% bigger or smaller, there would be no atoms, as there would not be any stable electron orbitals, and so on.",

When I moved to Bushwick 6 years ago my the rent for my 3 bedroom apartment was 1800, there were other options in that range, as well as similarly priced apartments in Crown Heights. Look at the prices today and the rents in those areas have almost doubled. The New York real estate market is insane right now and people are already investing in areas like East New York hoping that the gentrification and rising rents keep moving eastward. Commercial rent is less expensive than residential and people do great things in NYC but a giant space in Bushwick is going to be very expensive right now and you&#x27;re going to have to be good at turning a profit to keep the lights on.<p>That said I&#x27;m really curious what just opened up in Bushwick that matches the description of the social club in the article.",

Here, except for some internet banks (such as the non-German ING DiBa), you have to go to an office to arrange anything. In NL, most local branches are gone from villages and are slowly retracting from cities as well. Here you have many branches in a small city, with many employees (probably because stuff is all handled on paper) and royal interiors. And then you have to go to the bank every couple of weeks to print your statements using a machine (I am not making this up).<p>Compared to Northern European countries, there is a huge space for increasing efficiency.<p><i>there is no minimum salary</i><p>Yes.

  "text": "Hi, nice to here. I&#x27;m a co-author. Let me clarify some of your points.<p>1) Indeed, we consider visualization of graph dependencies in OntoMathPro as an important application for learning. Given sufficient coverage of relationships between concepts, it can provide a helpful context for any non-trivial term.<p>2) No, the ontology was constructed collaboratively and manually from scratch, and Wikipedia was just one of the used resources. BTW, overlapping between the math part of Wikipedia (or DBpedia as we think in terms of Linked Data) and OntoMathPro is saved in the mapping file (<a href=\"https://github.com/CLLKazan/OntoMathPro/blob/master/external.links.dbpedia.nt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CLLKazan&#x2F;OntoMathPro&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;external...</a>), which was extracted automatically afterwards.<p>3) Concerning &quot;ElementS of Probability Theory&quot;, could you please provide class URI you are talking about? Because I can see only this relevant one: E2406 <a href=\"http://ontomathpro.org/ontology/E2406___599545262.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ontomathpro.org&#x2F;ontology&#x2F;E2406___599545262.html</a> which has the proper name (without &#x27;s&#x27;).<p>4) We do allow and have multiple inheritance. Please see E1892 Differential Equation, which is a sub-class of both E1891 Equation and E2688 Element of Differential Equations. I believe there are more subtle examples in the ontology (can&#x27;t remember exactly for now).<p>5) About ontology engineering principles, if you are interested in, please peruse our research papers (especially, [2]), in which we elaborate our modeling principles.<p>6) I can&#x27;t agree about &#x27;weakness&#x27; of the chosen language. OWL 2 is quite expressive to provide non-trivial logical rules and properties. For examples, some of them are already in place: P5 &#x27;see also&#x27; property is transitive and symmetric. Surely, we can&#x27;t describe the precise semantics of mathematics (we would have to have a more expressive language than mathematics itself according to Popper&#x27;s methodology). But we don&#x27;t need it to build fascinating applications atop of the existing ontology, as our work hopefully shows.<p>BTW, I&#x27;d suggest using our mailing list further to keep these valuable discussions in the proper place: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ontomathpro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#!forum&#x2F;ontomathpro</a><p>Next, you can submit pull requests in GitHub with suggesting improvements, then we can discuss them there.<p>No offense to HN, it&#x27;s just to make our life easier.",

  "text": "You have the option of two monads, Maybe and Either. Usually errors are handled with the Either monad. An operation may either return a result or an error. Together with do syntax the Either monad gives you multiple choices in handling errors.<p>You can handle every single error explicitly (as in Go) using pattern matching<p><pre><code>  eitherResultOrError = operation1 arg\n\n  case eitherResultOrError of\n    Left error -&gt; handle error\n    Right result -&gt; handle&#x27; result\n</code></pre>\nIts also possible to chain multiple operations then check the error later. If an error occurs, the next operations in the chain will not execute.<p><pre><code>  let eitherResultOrError = do\n    x &lt;- operation1 arg\n    y &lt;- operation2 x + 1\n    z &lt;- operation3 x y\n\n  case eitherResultOrError of\n    Left error -&gt; handle error\n    Right result -&gt; handle&#x27; result\n</code></pre>\nOr simply use `orElse` to return a default value in case of errors.<p>For IO operations and other monadic actions, its best to use EitherT, ErrorT or MaybeT, which are monads that can add error handling to any other monad. To understand how these work, its probably best to implement MaybeT. Basically, they add another wrapper to other monads to redefine what the bind operator (`&gt;&gt;=`) does",

Use a sheet-metal spatula&#x2F;flipper<p>Humanity has known for a long time that when you get your cooking oil hot, it repels food instead of binding it to the cooking surface; but the amateur cook has forgotten because of a reliance on non-stick surfaces.<p>The sheet-metal spatula&#x2F;flipper lets you clean the cast iron with each pass of the tool. A rubber&#x2F;wooden tool will leave small, burnt on bits of food, which accumulate more bits of food; a sheet-metal tool with scrape those off before they become a problem. Also, a sheet-metal spatula will scrape the roughness of the cast-iron from the bottom of your pan over the course of decades, moving you towards that inky-black mirror of grandma&#x27;s old pans.<p>I can cook anything on my cast iron, just by following those steps, even fried eggs: the surface is totally non-stick.

The systems I&#x27;ve looked into seem to duplicate a lot of what the kernel and hardware are already doing.  They don&#x27;t seem to really distinguish between actively mapped memory and allocated but untouched memory.<p>With a 64-bit system, malloc could internally just reserve some vast logical address space and let the kernel fault pages in as needed.  Instead of having a single frontier, you might have thousands of arenas used for different slab sizes, each being automatically extended as needed.   Each arena would have a maximum waste up the 4KB page size, but on modern systems this seems unlikely to ever add up to a real burden.<p>You&#x27;d still need record keeping for allocations within a slab, but the page table itself would be the authoritative record for the arenas themselves.  All the pieces for this approach seem fairly straightforward. The only major thing lacking (I think) is an efficient userspace way to request the unmapping of a page that is no longer needed.<p>Is there research into this approach?  What key terms should I be searching for?<p>Edit:<p>I think this discussion may be about the same approach that I&#x27;m wondering about: <a href=\"http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6101\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;caml.inria.fr&#x2F;mantis&#x2F;view.php?id=6101</a><p>And this paper touches on a lot of the same issues, although coming at it from the direction of modifying the hardware: <a href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/isca13_direct_segment.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.cs.wisc.edu&#x2F;multifacet&#x2F;papers&#x2F;isca13_direct_...</a>",

The idea that creative arts are valued by some absolute aesthetic quality is to ignore not only the changing nature of quality itself, but also all the other purposes that art has. Art is also about commentary on the current culture, and that is just as good a reason to produce it as any. Not everything has to reach for the sublime, some people are just trying to illuminate something rather small and innocuous in a fairly humble manner and if their audience is small, no matter. As to the question of if we need more books, given we have more of a high quality than one person could read in a lifetime, like I said, quality isn&#x27;t everything. I want books that comment on the current world, not just books that are the best written.<p>Also, the idea that there is too much fiction available is a very anglo-centric position.

The Wagner can cook eggs like teflon; the Lodge, even after two years of heavy use is still pretty rough for eggs, its nonstick enough for most other foods.<p>Cast iron is nice and I prefer it for its properties besides the nonstick abiluty, but for the casual home cook making eggs, Teflon is pretty foolproof.",

  "text": "This article has a completely backwards approach. People prefer new art. This is a clearly observable fact. The article&#x27;s approach to this fact seems to be to declare everybody as making the wrong choice, essentially by fiat. It would be much more interesting to examine <i>why</i> people prefer new art and ask the question of <i>whether</i> the classics are underappreciated and if there would be a net benefit to encouraging them, rather than basically assuming the author&#x27;s tastes are some sort of objective fact and deriving a bunch of nonsense from it.<p>Personally, I think there&#x27;s a ton to be said for context. People want characters and situations they can relate to. At the end of the day, I&#x27;d generally prefer to read something where the protagonist uses an iPhone and cooks with a microwave than one where the protagonist writes letters and has his food cooked by slaves.<p>And of course it doesn&#x27;t have to be as dramatic as smartphones and slavery. Even a book from just a couple of decades ago is going to feel remarkably different due to changing attitudes towards everything from homosexuality to nuclear war.<p>But he completely refuses to consider such contextual advantages. He states flat out, &quot;People <i>are</i> better off reading the best books, and the best ones <i>are</i> predominately the ones that already exist, there <i>is</i> more than can be read, and new books have no compelling advantage over the classics.&quot; (Emphasis from the author.)<p>The concluding sentence is an excellent summary of the article, although not the way it&#x27;s meant to be: &quot;I have started with common-sense grounds and wound up somewhere strange.&quot; In my experience, when people justify things with &quot;common sense&quot; they often mean unsubstantiated claims that they don&#x27;t want to have to justify explicitly. If you start with &quot;common-sense grounds&quot; and end up somewhere strange, consider that maybe your starting assumptions are faulty!",

For example, even if movies like &quot;Baraka&quot; and &quot;Samsara&quot; already have been made, they still need to be made again, every few decades. And even in cases where the <i>audience</i> doesn&#x27;t need some things said many times in different ways; each <i>artist</i> still needs that act of actively saying it. I&#x27;m not an artist, but what creativity I do have in my life, it is for me. For example, I sometimes write lyrics and I rap them shittily, and I am pretty much not concerned what anyone but me thinks of them. They&#x27;re my little bubble in which I can clean my own soul, and who sees it or cares is not my concern. And while I don&#x27;t consider that &quot;making art&quot;, I know much worse things, that have nothing to say at all, are called art with a straight face. So technically, it&#x27;s art. And I don&#x27;t do it to get laid, I did it, as I said, to relieve pressure and come to terms with the world around me. I am not saying this is the sole motivation for art, but at least I don&#x27;t have to second guess artists with a message on their motivation, because I know it&#x27;s at least <i>possible</i> to not give a fuck, because I am doing it right now.. if society was so great I could seek its approval with a straight face, I would have no reason to write songs. So I&#x27;m not asking when I make &quot;art&quot;, I&#x27;m telling, and I don&#x27;t worry wether what I do is good enough for people, if anything I&#x27;d worry wether people are good enough for it. And I&#x27;m not making great things, you know, and still I take them seriously enough to feel that way. How much more so for &quot;real&quot; artists. It is said Bach wrote for God first and last; or was that just PR? Yeah he did it for a living, but his <i>motivation</i> was not to impress people. Are such people the exception of the rule, or is the rule just nonsense?<p>Though I agree, don&#x27;t encourage art, make it illegal. It will not stop people from being artists, but it would curb a lot of mediocrity :P",

  "text": "Agree with the other poster - it isn&#x27;t conflation. Art <i>is</i> a form of communication, like languages are. Language and art are concepts that overlap more often than not.<p>This permeates all aspects of our lives - there is no objective reason why &quot;red octagon&quot; means &quot;stop&quot; except that we have created a design language in which this is standard. Likewise we&#x27;ve constructed massive visual symbologies that have real meaning - the floppy disk icon, an upward pointing arrow, the male&#x2F;female symbols on restrooms that are so universal, etc. These are non-linguistic things that are nonetheless communication all the same.<p>There are even more complex manifestations of these symbols, techniques, and themes in fine arts - but in principle they are the same.<p>So to address your previous point:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;The main points of the article, as I understand it, are that society shouldn&#x27;t encourage the creation of new art, because we already have more than enough good art to last anyone a lifetime&quot;</i><p>This becomes a nonsensical statement, because art is communication - and like all communication it wears culture and politics all over it. Art is unique to the time and place where it is created - the same way a novel wears the signatures of the era in which it is written.<p>This would be like suggesting that we should shut down all newspapers, because we already have archives full of old newspapers, more than anyone can read in a lifetime.<p>Art is intrinsically, inseparably tied to the culture and time surrounding its creation. It is not substitutable in perpetuity like a daily vitamin pill. Art created in the 18th century is not the same as art created in the 19th century - and is not the same as art that will be created in years to come.<p>&gt; <i>&quot; and because artists are mostly motivated by social status anyway&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve known a lot of artists. I don&#x27;t think this statement is justified. You can say a lot of things - artists create for their ego, artists create for the approval of others, but &quot;social status&quot; brings in a lot of connotations that frankly aren&#x27;t warranted.<p>Art is insular frequently - many artists have no interest in appealing to the layman, and their works are often inscrutable to anyone who hasn&#x27;t spent a <i>lot</i> of time studying the art. Their primary interest in creation is communicating with others who are as studied as them in a particular topic. One can spin this as &quot;being driven by social status&quot; but in reality is no different than listening to the same music as your friends, or watching the same movies.<p>To try and bring this back to our world - think about an expert programmer who blogs about the finer points of compiler design. His blog is complete gibberish to the layman, and in fact is not understandable to most beginner programmers either. You <i>have</i> to have a certain background in order to understand what he&#x27;s writing - this is what a lot of art is like. The mistake here is that certain people have put this art in a museum and told everyone they should like it - in doing so creating a false impression that understanding what&#x27;s hanging on this wall is simple. It&#x27;s really not.<p>The criticism in the article is off-base precisely because of this. This is like an amateur programmer looking at this compiler design blog and saying &quot;all of this is gibberish I don&#x27;t understand, therefore bullshit&quot;. The reality is that these are expert works designed for experts in a field - and to understand it (not that you&#x27;re obligated to understand it at all) you have to work your way up to it, by understanding who has done what, where they came from, where they learned and copied from, etc etc.",

Tens, maybe less.<p>Even more recently, let&#x27;s take The Beatles and their contemporaries. Of course, The Beatles were not the only seminal artists of their time. They were active at the same time as David Bowie and The Rolling Stones. But again, how many of their contemporaries produced albums that are now forgotten by everyone who listened to them? How much of what&#x27;s left even now will be gone in another 75 years, when basically everyone who was alive in the 60s is dead?<p>The only difference between the 60s (or early 1800s) and now is that we haven&#x27;t yet forgotten all the crap that is being put out today. Will future historians of pop music assign more than a footnote to Katie Perry or Taylor Swift 50 years from now? Will they even get a footnote?<p>So the reason old art is the best art is simply that we&#x27;ve had time to weed out all the crap. The remaining art that we still remember is the best of what was released at the time. It&#x27;s not the best because all old was better, it&#x27;s the best because it&#x27;s been better curated.<p>In fact, for all we know, the overall proportion of art that is good might be even better today, but that doesn&#x27;t change his proposition that we don&#x27;t really <i>need</i> new art in order to experience great art for the rest of our lives.",

If one of us has only <i>two</i> of the cremes (e.g., [M]e has two and [Y]ou have one), we agree 5&#x2F;9ths of the time<p><pre><code>      M M Y\n    M 1 1 0\n    M 1 1 0\n    Y 0 0 1\n</code></pre>\nIf we run this experiment many, many times, we should converge upon (2&#x2F;8 * 9&#x2F;9) + (6&#x2F;8 * 5&#x2F;9) = 2&#x2F;3 of the time our measurements agree. This would be consistent with a model of &quot;preprogrammed&quot; quantum Oreos. This is not what we see in practice. When we actually run this experiment, our measurements agree exactly 50% of the time which can only be explained if the quantum Oreos are not preprogrammed.",

Genomics is not presently one of them, we just need lots of compute time on fairly normal servers.<p>The HPC does get used of course, but not for purely technical reasons. Genomics workloads should move to the cloud and be run at off-peak times to take advantage of cheaper pricing, but there are significant barriers to this as researchers can often get started on the HPC for free whereas cloud services require a purchasing card. Their cluster will also have some support and someone who can install software dependencies into the stack.<p>(As a result most genomics software is really, really hard to get running on anything other than the author&#x27;s institutions HPC and its unique set of installed packages.)<p>Another barrier is just knowledge (it&#x27;s hard to keep those people around in the current market) and university projects often have strange incentices due to central services (paid for out of general overheads) having no marginal cost.",

I&#x27;ve also lived overseas in France. I&#x27;ve been to the bay area, NYC, Miami, pretty much everywhere among other hot spots, but haven&#x27;t lived in those places.<p>I&#x27;m going to be honest, I know DSM well and if it were so great I&#x27;d be there now. I&#x27;m not sold on the growing hype train about DSM, and the cheap cost of living is an excuse for employers to give you lower wages. It&#x27;s a nice, progressive city though.<p>So yes, the best part about DSM is that it is a nice city, albeit a bit small. Part of the influx of people are younger Iowans gathering there as the other cities&#x2F;towns have gone bust.<p>As an individual with gainful employment, stay where you are unless you&#x27;re made an offer in DSM. I can&#x27;t honestly recommend anyone pack up and make the move without. A lot of employees run around that city with the same few insurance companies on their resumes. It&#x27;s just a very small market.<p>The short answer to your question IMO is that in the &#x27;midwest revival&#x27; cities group, it&#x27;s one of the best choices. It&#x27;s better for a founder than it is as an employee though.<p>I&#x27;m also looking to put down some roots at this point, Seattle, Chicago and maybe Portland are in the running. If you&#x27;re from the west coast I personally would pick Seattle.<p>For myself, I&#x27;m likely returning to Chicago to put down roots and buy a home, as a robust public transportation system means more to me than any other metric.

Every other barbecue item has a relatively long shelf life—contrary to what some snobs tell you, it doesn&#x27;t need to be eaten straight from the smoker. At Franklin Barbecue in Austin, Texas, Aaron Franklin takes his brisket out at 3 a.m. to rest while the rest of his menu items cook. The restaurant opens at 11 a.m. and sells out shortly thereafter, which means that brisket you waited on line for hours for has been sitting in a warming box for no fewer than eight hours.<p>&gt; In a barbecue setting, everything is done and cooked long before you show up. Now chicken? Kept warm, it&#x27;ll stay nice and juicy for maybe an hour. After that it&#x27;s all downhill.<p>It sounds like both #1 and #2.",

It might allow for some novel economic activity in very poor areas without internet. It would obviously be receive-only, but that could still be useful. It might provide an equivalent to pre-internet banking in areas too poor to be served by banks. (&quot;Pre-internet banking&quot; means you have to take a trip to the bank to send money, but you can call up and ask your balance to make sure you got paid.)",

  "text": "I’ve worked in the food industry for quite a while, 16 years I think, often in kitchens but sometimes in other areas. About 20 months ago I launched my own food business. I’m the only employee. The few products I sell should be served fresh, so I go to the kitchen 364 days a year to prepare and deliver fresh goods. In some ways I can relate to Tyson Ho, in others I can’t, the difference being only how our work is similar or divergent.<p>He’s had much more attention than I’ve had. I’m not certain what he did to garner it, but I’ve worked hard to fly under the radar. From following the tech industry (and others) for many years, I’ve made it a point to not grow too fast, to avoid taking on more than is possible, physically or economically. I’d rather under-promise and then over-deliver. Or, as is often discussed in places like HN, I want to manage customers’ expectations.<p>One result is that I’ve done no marketing beyond some occasional use of Twitter. I don’t even have a website yet. In fact, I haven’t solicited one customer. Speaking to one person in food retail led to that person carrying my products when I launched, and every customer since has come by word of mouth. Since I only wholesale, my customers are not the people ultimately buying my products for consumption. So I do everything to keep my customers happy, word gradually spreads about my products, and other retailers find their way to me.<p>Still, I can understand the tight economics Mr. Ho describes. I was profitable within weeks of launching, but I’m not rolling in money by any stretch. I’d hate to know what I make on an hourly basis. But I don’t know because it’s not one of the measures I use for gauging whether this is succeeding. I measure myself by my performance in the kitchen —things like punctuality, product quality, sanitation. I measure customer service by my customers&#x27; satisfaction with how I handle their needs. And I measure the bottom line simply by whether or not the bank balance is going up.<p>He discussed balancing work with other aspects of life. I’m content with how I’ve done there. Mind you, I’m single and childless, so it’s not fair to compare me to him. But I’ve maintained some social life (that was never too big for me), and I’ve continued the long-distance friendships I’ve long been part of.<p>All told, I’ve never understood why people get into this industry. It’s physically brutal, mentally endless, hard to make decent money, and customer expectations are brutal. On that last one, I’ll note that every industry has its odd customer expectations, but food is one of the oddest I’ve ever noticed. Example: You have a date with your significant other. The restaurant darn well better seat the two of you within minutes of your reservation time. In contrast, the doctor’s office has a waiting room you’re likely to sit in no matter how punctual you are. Another example: Unless something sells out from popularity, food customers usually don’t tolerate things being unavailable. “I’m sorry, there’s no bread for the table because the oven broke” isn’t something you hear, and that’s because customers, and in turn restaurant owners, won’t tolerate it.<p>The best description I’ve ever heard about restaurant life is that it’s like working in an emergency room but without the life and death. But you can bet anyone worth their salt in a kitchen treats it like like and death. Still, I enjoy what I do and find both the work and customer service rewarding. I don’t blame anyone for trying this industry and fleeing it as fast as possible. And since it sounds like Mr. Ho is doing good work, I certainly hope he’s able to make his business work.",

According to her blog the paper was rejected because: &quot;Reviewers at conferences [...] have been very skeptical, and pressed us multiple times to produce some kind of comparison of basic block versioning against tracing.&quot;[1] I think this is a very valid concern. When you describe a new scientific approach (Basic Block Versioning) you should compare to the state of the art. Otherwise it is very hard for the reader to judge the merit of the new approach. However I agree with your sentiment that a new approach should not only be judged by performance numbers (there is actually a nice article going deeper on this topic on databasearchitects[2]). But there should at least be a more thorough theoretical discussion than only 3-4 sentences. Benchmarks comparing to existing approaches in this case can help to show pathological cases which might indicate weaknesses of the approach or to empirically demonstrate the feasibility of the new approach.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://pointersgonewild.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/the-fastest-for-in-loops-in-the-whole-wide-web/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pointersgonewild.wordpress.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-fastest...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://databasearchitects.blogspot.de/2014/09/experiments-hurt-review-process.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;databasearchitects.blogspot.de&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;experiments-hu...</a><p>EDIT: Many conferences also allow publishing papers without a deep comparison to exisiting research in the industrial session.

Again discussion does not have to mean that you have to be faster than all existing systems. Paper acceptance is always a little bit a random process, but at least in this case the review comments are valid from my point of view and her phd advisor should probably have detected these problems in proofreading before submitting.

Yeah I know more techno savvy boys than girls but why.<p>I could argue about mechanics&#x2F;electricity engineering that there is something there.

He called the cops to his house after it was burgled, he admitted to them that he was in a homosexual relationship, he chose 1 year of estrogen shots over jail, an autopsy suggested that he died of inhalation of cyanide from an apparatus for gold electroplating spoons, using potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold, which Turing had set up in his tiny spare room. (suggesting that there was no suicide)<p>Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) &quot;with good humour&quot; and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, in fact, setting down a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend.<p>Gay activists are starting to sound like blacks in America.

The only complaint I&#x27;d have is that good new SF tends to be more accurate and believable, due to the surgeries authors actually seeing how tech and science has progressed. Older works tend to feel dated because the tech surpasses what they&#x27;ve envisioned. Yet, only sometimes. E.g. reading Asimov&#x27;s Robot series, I didn&#x27;t feel the effect of things being so dated.<p>So given I&#x27;d probably be more content with the top works from time past, he&#x27;s correct that creating new works is simply not as valuable as it used to be.

It&#x27;s not the &quot;History of Science&quot; as a subject of study in and of itself or a specific academic field, but rather the large corpus of existing results and publications that&#x27;s having an effect.<p>I find this distinction very important, because it helps separate the immediate process of science--the people, the historical quirks--from the actual results. It&#x27;s not a perfect division, of course, but I think it&#x27;s pretty good in most scientific fields and also very important. It helps distance science, the cumulative understanding of our world, from the people who produced it who are, after all, just human. In my view, this is the main goal of the scientific process, so it&#x27;s just another component of what makes science <i>science</i>.<p>This is also not to say that the history of science is not interesting or worth studying on its own, merely that it is something largely distinct from the underlying science itself and should ideally be kept that way.",

These include a different API (you can pass in some flags that explicitly direct it how to do alignment, initialization, etc), reduced use of sbrk in favor of mmap, multiple arenas for allocations of different sizes, per-cpu arenas to eliminate lock contention, etc.<p>Mozilla has been using jemalloc since the release of Firefox 3 in 2008, primarily because having multiple arenas for allocations of different sizes means that you end up with less fragmentation over time. Fragmentation happens when you deallocate ten 100-byte objects that are scattered around in memory, then need to allocate one thousand-byte object. You can&#x27;t reuse those 10-byte empty spots in memory, because that 1000-byte allocation has to be contiguous. This means that your total memory usage has to grow. Jemalloc puts small allocations into buckets where they&#x27;ll be closer together, making it more likely that new allocations will be able to fill the holes left by deallocations, and that freeing small objects will eventually empty a memory page, allowing you to return the page to the OS.<p>I remember that we were all pretty chuffed at the improvements in Firefox&#x27;s memory usage; it was quite significant and would surely reduce the general perception that Firefox was a memory hog. Just using jemalloc reduced memory usage by 22% (<a href=\"http://blog.pavlov.net/2008/03/11/firefox-3-memory-usage/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pavlov.net&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;firefox-3-memory-usage&#x2F;</a> has a really amazing graph comparing FF2 and FF3 to IE7).<p>Rust uses jemalloc for the same reasons; there&#x27;s just no technical reason not to use it.",

Rental application software is just a widget that we sell that has commercial value and therefore pays the bills.<p>What we do is: software delivery, customer service, operations, listening to our customers, and a bunch of other stuff that is immediately translatable to &lt;any other widget&gt;.  But we do the absolute best in industry at those things.<p>So I&#x27;m not really passionate necessarily about &quot;what I do&quot; in the way people thing (rental application software), but we&#x27;re really passionate about &quot;what I do&quot; in the way that I think of it (running the best damn business).<p>Rental application software is just this tiny, tiny, tiny kernel of a thing makes it easy to classify what we do into an industry or subject bucket -- but for what we deliver, what we think about, what we <i>REALLY DO</i>, that tiny kernel occupies less than 5% of our thoughts.<p>I have on more than one occasion heard founders (maybe in the process of pitching for investment dollars) say things like:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;This is my life&#x27;s work.

The cause was heartburn, triggered by an earlier night of celebratory drinking, irritating my esophagus. The irritation was close enough to my diaphragm to stimulate it.<p>One dose of thorazine, given by the ER doctor, and the hiccoughs subsided. Thorazine dampens the vagus nerve. This was the intended effect. Less intended was my complete lack of motivation to do anything outside the confines of my apartment for the rest of the weekend. (I also took great interest in my neighbourhood parks, for once.)",

Usually the only thing that can be done in that case is to reload the whole thing, and then tediously scroll back to where you were. It&#x27;s gotten better in recent implementations, but it still happens from time to time.<p>It&#x27;s also annoying when I need to catch up after a long time away (or if it&#x27;s a site I haven&#x27;t read before). Depending on the site and what else I have going on at the time, I might read a given site over the course of days or weeks. I do usually leave the tab or window open, but sometimes it gets closed or reloaded for one reason or another. And again, as you say, you can scroll to the first unfamiliar thing, but when it&#x27;s the equivalent of 10 or 20 pages back, that&#x27;s a pain. And it&#x27;s even worse when the &quot;it won&#x27;t load anymore&quot; problem happens.<p>It&#x27;s a usability tradeoff, but I have had many more frustrating experiences with infinite scrolling over the past few years than I ever had with paginated indices in the 20+ years I&#x27;ve been using the web.",

If time and energy don&#x27;t have to be spent rediscovering something, the more it can be spent on building on the existing knowledge instead.<p>It will be interesting to see. Though, in order to reap the benefits, time and energy needs to spent reading and familiarizing one&#x27;s self with the older literature. An unfortunate result of the &quot;publish or perish&quot; culture of science today is the explosion in the number of papers being published. This makes it difficult to keep up with, and digest, the new results that are coming out. Given that, it may be difficult for people to add to that the older literature.<p>Certainly one could argue that understanding the old literature first is the correct way to go about it, but one cannot sacrifice an understanding of the recent literature. Papers can get dinged for only citing old results, which can have the unintended side-effect of suggesting: a) that particular topic is dead, as a field of study, or b) that the authors are unable to their work in the context of recent results, which shows a lack of knowledge of the field. So, keeping up with the current&#x2F;recent literature is neceessary, and there are only so many hours in a day.<p>It is certainly no excuse for not knowing the older literature, but it is a realistic constraint on what can be expected.<p>Edit: I should add, the electronic access to old Astronomy articles has been of great help to me, and has resulted in my finding and reading older papers which are relevant to the work I am doing. It would have been much more difficult when the only way to read the papers was to find a physical copy of the journal.",

(28*1.28 = 36). So, in 1990 a significant number of citations were already older papers.<p>I wonder if there is a way to weight individual citations within each work (e.g., by age of the paper cited?) to further strengthen the signal.<p>Also, at some point, the fraction of old papers cited should approach 0% (the fields had to start sometime). It would be interesting to reproduce this analysis for time bins which are older. I presume one would find that the fraction of citations that are to papers 10 years or older would be a monotonically increasing function of time. So one then needs to ask if this increase is due to better access to articles or if it is simply due to there being a larger body of work which is older than 10 years?",

What homoiconicity refers to is where the language syntax mirrors the metadata markup - just as you described here with JSON &#x2F; Javascript. In fact it&#x27;s a common feature of LISP and it&#x27;s descendants, Scheme obviously being one. So it&#x27;s not that surprising that Javascript also inherited homoiconicity from Scheme.<p>The other interesting thing about my research on Wikipedia was the tangent it took me on. I started reading about other other homoiconicity languages that I hadn&#x27;t heard of; and that lad me to a page about the programming language &quot;Curl&quot;[2] (not related to the cURL HTTP client that most Linux &#x2F; UNIX sysadmins would be well versed in). Curl is very interesting as it merges the different stacks of web development (markup, style sheets and scripting engine) in a unified language that can still be abstracted separately if one so chooses. Baring the syntax, it was exactly the type of concept I was suggesting a little while back when myself and a few friends were discussing ideal world scenarios of how we&#x27;d reinvent the web-development stack.<p>Anyhow, Red is definitely an interesting language in itself. But it&#x27;s always a bonus when one interesting post on HN leads you on a journey of a few other discoveries.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homoiconicity</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curl_%28programming_language%29</a>",

  "text": "Second BuckRoger&#x27;s post, in general.  I&#x27;m a native rural Iowan, who lived in Des Moines (DSM) part of my career, and am there often for family purposes.<p>My recommendation is simple:<p>Unless you are a CPA, actuary, lawyer or some other bureaucrat, don&#x27;t move to DSM. In fact, I&#x27;ve advised many people to move away.<p>The reasons are simple.<p>While there are both tech and brick&#x2F;mortar startups in DSM, the scene isn&#x27;t huge and it does have life-span issues.  Startup City closed up shop this fall after 2-3 years.  Gravitate--the co-working spot mentioned in the article--is the latest in a series of attempted co-working spots over the past several years.<p>Regular employment options are a huge concern too.  DSM is government, insurance, mortgages and banking, with a handful of ag and convenience-store companies thrown in the mix.  The common refrain I hear from old colleagues and family working for insurance&#x2F;financial services companies is how unsatisfied&#x2F;miserable they are, and how they wish there was someplace better to go.<p>The marketing, advertising and publishing companies shouldn&#x27;t be forgotten either. (Hint: re-read that last sentence in context of the article.)<p>Another huge thing people don&#x27;t often consider is airfare costs.  DSM International traditionally has had very high airfares--so high, many companies have sent their employees to Omaha or Kansas City to catch flights, because it&#x27;s more cost effective--even with mileage and hotel bills.<p>Ignore the hype.  There are much better places to live and work than Des Moines.  I now live and have my own business in the Minneapolis&#x2F;St. Paul (Twin Cities) metro, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  For everything the article states about Des Moines, MSP is several orders of magnitude better.",

My understanding is that most of that is tax abatements; Tesla agreed to locate a huge industrial plant in that state in exchange for 20 years of no property, sales, and payroll taxes.<p>What Nevada gets in return is 6,500 permanent jobs, $43 million paid to a local school district, a highway rerouted, and massive ripple effects of all that industrial activity.  For example, the Reno airport is about to become very busy, as will local grocery stores, restaurants, motels, hardware stores, lumber supply stores, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not as though Nevada <i>would have been</i> $1.4 billion richer if Tesla had not located a plant there.  This notion however is widely expressed on the internet and suggests that people do not understand what a tax break means.",

It is a primary goal of artificial intelligence research and an important topic for science fiction writers and futurists. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as &quot;strong AI&quot;, &quot;full AI&quot; or as the ability to perform &quot;general intelligent action&quot;.&#x27;[1] In comparison to just AI, which is currently available in modern tech as algorithms and such (see Watson).

It&#x27;s true that drug companies love to repurpose existing FDA-approved drugs, both because it saves them money and because it typically permits them to patent the compound again in a new context, but there are nonetheless real benefits to the public at large when a drug whose side effects are comparatively well-characterized over the long term is put into service to treat a different malady.",

  "text": "You don&#x27;t need to have a single frontier, and IIRC no one does these days. A stack of slabs per &quot;arena&quot; suffices, and the extra cost is only a read from a cacheline you&#x27;ll soon need anyway. It looks like jemalloc uses a tree of &quot;runs&quot; for that.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what you&#x27;re imagining, but I don&#x27;t see how you can pass this off to the kernel. You need a slab which has free memory. How do you know where to find it? You could write a nasty new syscall to ask the kernel for a ZFOD page(s), and then cry because your program is slow.<p>Also, unless your slabs are huge and your allocator is being used to fuel some kind of pre-caching, faulting pages is going to be suboptimal. You incur at least twice as many mode switches: one for the mmap call, one for each faulting page. I&#x27;ve measured this, and it gets pretty expensive. I&#x27;m kind of dubious about the performance of schemes which stray from the principle of &quot;allocate what you actually need; free it when you don&#x27;t.&quot;<p>The bottom line is that a slab allocator should be solving a different, mostly less general problem than the kernel. It needs finer granularity and it&#x27;s optimizing for common block sizes that are small enough to fit into slabs of known sizes. So it should optimize for allocating page chunks in a small subset of possible sizes (namely, the slab size(s)), while the kernel should be worried about unbounded, oddly-sized page chunks.<p>I toyed with scalable allocators for a course a few years back. It&#x27;s a little embarassing, but if you want to see what the costs actually are: \n<a href=\"http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/apodolsk/418/finalreport.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.andrew.cmu.edu&#x2F;user&#x2F;apodolsk&#x2F;418&#x2F;finalreport.html</a><p>You can do lockfree slab allocators pretty easily, so the game in scalable malloc is really about avoiding inter-CPU cacheline sharing and fitting your data structures into per-CPU caches. Slabs happen to be really good for that, for non-obvious reasons.",

  "text": "There&#x27;s no one right answer. At the end of the day it is about perspective. Specifically, Scott Adams&#x27; father was loan officer at a bank. Banks are fairly conservative when it comes to giving loans. They want to see business plans and analyze hard numbers before they commit money to entrepreneurs. So when amateurs come to them asking for funding for an idea because &quot;it is their passion,&quot; of course the bank turns them down, for passion alone is insufficient AND it has the risk of blinding someone to the reality of how commercially viable the idea really is.<p>On the other hand, all other things being equal, someone being passionate about basket weaving is more likely to make a successful business out of it than someone who is in it just for the money. Passion can be a nearly bottomless source of motivation, which helps people stick it out when things get rough. After all, starting and running a business is like a roller-coaster ride: one needs to endure the lows to enjoy the highs.<p>I think that could be a successful formula for co-founding teams: you need one person who is deeply passionate about the topic and another whose main strength is figuring out how to monetize it. That&#x27;s how Apple became successful.",

  "text": "Unfortunate as it is, peer review is quite broken and it is not quite clear how to fix it. Even if the intended goal is otherwise, in practice, peer review in CS turns into an adversarial exercise, with some differences in levels.<p>Rather than inspecting a submission and thinking if there is anything in the paper that might be of interest to the community, could the paper spur real progress, the review process usually boils down to: can I quickly skim to find something &#x2F; anything with which I can shoot down this paper and get away with it and get done with this review. This of course is a generalization, not implying that this is what happened here. Unfortunately, the prototypical reviewer has become more like a prosecutor. There are various reasons why this has become the norm, people are aware of it, some are even trying hard to figure out ways to make it better, whereas some believe this is exactly how it should be.<p>If accuracy of prediction was a concern, Copernican model would never have been accepted. It took years of polish to make the then new model attain the accuracy of the then prevalent model. Some would argue that such models (the Copernican for example) should remain unpublished and under covers till they beat state of the art. I personally do not agree with this view. I would rather have a reasonably well baked but not yet perfect model out in the ether soon so that the model can enlist &#x2F; recruit other people to work on it. It really boils down to where in the spectrum should the community operate: (i) spammed by advances of questionable merit, with the community spending effort to winnow the good from the bad or (ii) making sure that only the rock solid ones get through, at the risk of delaying or extinguishing useful advance and waiting for a rediscovery.",

The lowest string\nin frequency is the G, the first G below\nmiddle C on a piano.  The other three strings\nare, left to right to the player,\nD, A, and E.  Each adjacent pair of strings differ in\nfrequency by a musical <i>perfect fifth</i> \nso that, three times the frequency of the\nlower string in the pair is the same as two\ntimes the frequency of the higher string in\nthe pair.  So, as move across the strings from\nG to D, A, and E, at each step are multiplying\nfrequency by 3&#x2F;2 which, then, must be, and is,\na nicely good approximation to 2^(7&#x2F;12) which\nis essentially what a piano is forced to do\nfor those notes.<p>A lot in violin playing is from listening to \n<i>harmonics</i>, that is, <i>overtones</i>, that is\n<i>Fourier</i> analysis.<p>Also that each string has a <i>natural frequency</i>\nof vibration is essentially a Fourier point.<p>But, wait, there&#x27;s more, and much earlier!\nNewton ran a beam of white light through\na prism which is a Fourier analysis --\nessentially\na power spectrum via Fourier transform.\nThen Newton was smart enough (uh, he was\na bright guy) to use a second prism and\nshow that the individual colors could not\nbe further decomposed.  So, somehow the first\nprism did some fundamental decomposition.<p>Also, some armies knew that soldiers walking\nacross a bridge should not march in step.\nWhy?

  "text": "I wonder if the increase in the percentage of citation to older articles is related to the overall access situation getting better, though? Not that long ago, &gt;10 yr old scientific articles were often quite difficult to access: shunted into &quot;old journal&quot; paper archives somewhere in a basement, from which they had to be specially requested. The library shelves typically only held 5-10 years of recent journal issues, and digitization efforts (at least in science) typically started with only the recent issues as well. To make matters worse, the old issues were rarely full-text indexed, so you might never even discover something relevant existed in the first place, much less try to access it. Nowadays an article from 1965 might randomly come up in a Google Scholar search, which was not the case in, say, 2002.<p>A more speculative hypothesis: this relates to the general &quot;flattening&quot; of the literature, as people relate to it more via search and less via subscriptions. People no longer really read journals as periodicals, or even use a specific journal&#x27;s index as a search aid, but rather search entire archives for things.

  "text": "The claimed stat seems more ambiguous to me on which of those possibilities is the case. It&#x27;s specifically citations to old papers that are increasing. That is the <i>original</i> old papers, not just their results. Citing old results &quot;updated&quot; or &quot;collected&quot;, in e.g. a modern textbook or survey article is one thing, and could more plausibly be divorced from the history of science. But if people are really reading (vs. just blindly citing, which may be the case) old scientific papers, that seems more to me like the history of science, in at least a somewhat broader sense, is poking its way into modern science more significantly than it used to.<p>When you read the original papers, they come along with their whole historical era, all the way down to the quirks of language, notation, problem framing, epistemological assumptions, etc. You even, sometimes, need to know something about the history-of-science as a field to correctly read and interpret a paper from a different era, which you probably want to do if you are really citing it for significant content. (Admittedly, a lot of the citations are probably throwaway cites to old papers the authors haven&#x27;t themselves read, along the lines of &quot;This was first studied in 1927 [1]&quot;. In that case someone still needs to do some history-of-science work to read this 1927 paper and characterize it accurately as &quot;first&quot; to study some problem... but that work might be done by someone else.)",

The communities are not adversarial so much as they are enamored with science. I think from that perspective, rejection is understandable: they want more numbers and comparisons, and might accept the paper even if these numbers are not very enlightening (call it going through the motions). You also don&#x27;t get many points just for wild experimentation.<p>For the same reason, many of the papers accepted seem very incremental and disappointing from a &quot;new idea&quot; perspective; and once you get the paper in, you have to go to the conference (I&#x27;m not a PLDI&#x2F;POPL person)! One can always publish in a &quot;new idea&quot; PL conference (like my personal choice, Onward!, and there is even a new one called SNAPL from the people that brought us PLDI and POPL), but the points you get for publishing at those venues aren&#x27;t as much as the true technical conferences (I don&#x27;t care, since I have a job, but for a grad student, its a big deal).<p>My advice would be to suck it up and write a good PLDI paper. Be very thorough and honest with numbers and comparisons, and try to do it &quot;right&quot; (no pointless numbers that don&#x27;t contribute to the story even if they might &quot;work&quot;). Then with a little bit of luck in PC reviewer selection (most PLDI reviewers are reasonable, some are not), the paper would probably get in. And if they do it right, it could be a really good paper that are lacking these days. Actually, that is another point: sometimes rejection is good, because the paper that gets in later is much much better. Patience.",

  "text": "&gt; <i>&quot;Most people are just looking for some simple thrills&quot;</i><p>This is patently untrue. Two of the top films in theaters right now are <i>Interstellar</i> and <i>Gone Girl</i>, neither of which can reasonably fit under the umbrella of &quot;simple thrills&quot;. In fact <i>Gone Girl</i> has been widely described as a very <i>difficult</i> film to watch in terms of its emotional impact on its audience - suffice it to say the appreciation of that film goes above and beyond mere entertainment, yet both are &quot;popular art&quot; in the sense that they are widely consumed by the mainstream.<p>The general public is capable of a substantial amount of artistic understanding, and there are more experts out there than you acknowledge. Appreciation of different types, genres, and subgenres of art change over time as a reflection of culture.<p>One good modern example of this is the comic book movie - comic books have unique thematic, structural, and aesthetic elements to them that were previously the exclusive territory of comic book nerds. In recent years this has gone spectacularly mainstream - and hundreds of millions of people now better understand stuff that used to be pretty inscrutable.<p>All art exist in a spectrum between the novice and the expert, mainstream society is quite expert at some (see: music, cinema) but not currently practiced in others (see: postmodernism). To boil the artistic sensibilities of the mainstream down to &quot;simple thrills&quot; is not only grossly cynical, it&#x27;s grossly incorrect.<p>&quot;Popular art&quot; is not mere entertainment - and it has never been, and has always been a reflection of the time and place in which it&#x27;s created. <i>Captain America</i> - popular right now - was a nationalistic symbol created during the midst of WW2 when it was felt that such a symbol be needed. The utopian portrayal of the future in the original <i>Star Trek</i> attracted viewers as an optimistic opposite to the Cold War. Heck, the conflict between the Federation and the Klingons is a direct analogy between the USA and the USSR (and naturally, the Federation always prevails).<p>And these art forms evolve - just this year we&#x27;ve had two massively profitable films between the X-Men and Captain America where the US government was portrayed as openly malevolent, and one of them directly addressed governmental spying. These works transparently reflect the times in which they were made. With the increasing media attention on drone strikes worldwide, even the <i>RoboCop</i> remake wasn&#x27;t spared - the movie went from a reflection of 1980s crime anxiety to a reflection of 2010s morality re: drone strikes.<p>This isn&#x27;t just movies either - Tupac built a huge mainstream career and long-standing legacy on works that plainly and openly commented on crime, race, and equality in the context of 1990s America. He&#x27;s far from the only one - the general public is <i>much</i> more capable of expert artistic appreciation than you give them credit.<p>People seek commentary, understanding, belonging, and even escape from the world and times in which they live, and popular art has provided this, and in this way they are not substitutable. The notion that people can or should subsist on past art exclusively is plainly false, as is the basis assumption that &quot;popular art&quot; is merely entertainment.",

Then bow the\nA string and the E string together, listen to the\nthird overtone from the A string and the second\novertone from the E string and adjust the E string\nuntil the beats (for each x Hz difference in frequency,\nx beats a second) disappear.  The overtones being used\nare the sine-cosine components in the Fourier series decomposition of the periodic sounds.",

  "text": "Probably the fact that it eagerly coalesces newly freed blocks where high performance allocators like tcmalloc and jemalloc use slabs of fixed-sized blocks which are never coalesced. Coalescing will load adjacent blocks into cache, and it probably implies doubly linked lists where slab allocators can get away with cache-friendlier single links or bitmaps etc. (Because you probably have to remove a block from the middle of a free list if you&#x27;ve just coalesced it with a newly freed block). It turns out cache footprint is key for speed and scalability in allocators, so that&#x27;s a big problem.<p>I&#x27;m embarassed to link this twice in a row now, but at one point I played around with the perf of a couple allocators, including glibc&#x27;s ptmalloc.

  "text": "One of the pitfalls when analyzing HPC requirements is to start with a model that&#x27;s too simplistic - and matrix multiplication is typical for that. What you usually want to run is a solver or simulation. These have timesteps and numerical approximation algorithms (e.g. Runge-Kutta) where you want to make sure that intermediate values live only exactly as long as they need. The reason being that when you distribute your main memory to your threads, especially for GPGPU, you only have a few hundred kilobytes per thread if you want to achieve saturation. So what do you do? In C you typically see the inner timestep functions being called with output and input pointers, then these are swapped for the next step - no allocation, no copying, no overhead, very simple code and nothing that any compiler could screw up. That&#x27;s just one example of a trick that makes a HPC programmer&#x27;s life easy, not just because it performs optimally 100% of the times it&#x27;s used, but because it doesn&#x27;t complicate performance analysis. In order to be able to analyse code performance properly, one must be able to understand to device code that comes out of the compiler, and how it will interact with the pipeline, the cache etc. If there&#x27;s too much of a mismatch, it becomes near impossible to understand what&#x27;s going on. In theory compilers could always achieve the optimum for you and a programmer wouldn&#x27;t have to care about hardware at all, and just live in his logical bubble. Experience shows that this ideal is pretty far off in the future.",

There should be regulation that prevents rate of expansion into new &#x27;fuzzily defined&#x27; target markets that is scientifically regulated with scientific, precisely and pedantically defined, formalized language. This personally horrifies me, and I watched this happen over and over again in federally funded facilities:<p>&gt; When someone&#x27;s antidepressant didn&#x27;t work, Pharma marketers began floating the idea that it wasn&#x27;t that the drugs didn&#x27;t work; it wasn&#x27;t that the person wasn&#x27;t depressed to begin with but had real life, job and family problems—it was &quot;treatment-resistant depression.&quot;<p>Over-prescription in general seems to come from ill equipped &#x2F; underfunded facilities. These are places that can&#x27;t afford to give every person individual therapy. They are communal, so there is lots of personality clashing that goes on inside of the facilities that exacerbates disorders which stem from or are composed largely of adaptive socialization behaviors that become maladaptive in different environments. A person who grew up in poverty or from an abusive environment is going to be angry and depressed. Just because there is no one available to have an intelligent kind of compassion for that person, doesn&#x27;t make them psychotic. People are afraid of what they don&#x27;t understand in general. It&#x27;s easier and cheaper to zonk someone out than actually have to think about or pay how to help them.<p>I really don&#x27;t mean to come off so cynical, but some of these public facilities can be blackholes for many of the people they treat, with the possibility of re-traumatizing people on top of the problems they already have.<p>Oh, and on top of that, the humorous part (read with heavy sarcasm): people at these places are called &quot;clients&quot; and the facility stresses that that specific phrasing is used.

The only reason for it to exist is because C# hasn&#x27;t got proper tuple support.<p>By the way, creating a new variable half-way down a method is also creating a new scope (the variable isn&#x27;t in scope above the declaration, and it is in scope below it, until the end of the method).<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    public int GetSurnameLength()\n    {\n        string fullName = ReadFullNameFromDb();\n        Tuple&lt;string,string&gt; result = ParseName(fullName);\n        return result.Item2.Length;\n    }  \n</code></pre>\nHas the same effect as:<p><pre><code>    public int GetSurnameLength()\n    {\n        string fullName = ReadFullNameFromDb();\n        return ParseName(fullName).Apply( (first,last) =&gt; last.Length );\n    }  \n\n</code></pre>\nThe only real downside to the Apply method is the syntax clutter from the closure.

  "text": "NIST Randomness Beacon\nSummary:\nNIST is implementing a prototype source of public randomness. The prototype (at <a href=\"https://beacon.nist.gov/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beacon.nist.gov&#x2F;home</a>) uses two independent commercially available sources of randomness, each with an independent hardware entropy source and SP 800-90-approved components.<p>The Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability, autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are made available by the source. Autonomy means that the source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a set of users can access the source in such a way that they are confident that they all receive the same random string.\nDescription:<p>The Beacon will broadcast full-entropy bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and signed, and includes the hash of the previous value to chain the sequence of values together. This prevents all, even the source, from retroactively changing an output packet without being detected. The beacon keeps all output packets and makes them available online.<p>DRBG Beacon System Diagram\nUses:<p>Tables of random numbers have probably been used for multiple purposes at least since the Industrial Revolution. The first published table appears to be by the English statistician L.H.C. Tippett. In the digital age, algorithmic random number generators have largely replaced these tables. The NIST Randomness Beacon expands the use of randomness to multiple scenarios in which the latter methods cannot be used. The extra functionalities stem mainly from three features. First, the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be predicted before they are published. Second, the public, time-bound, and authenticated nature of the Beacon allows a user application to prove to anybody that it used truly random numbers not known before a certain point in time. Third, this proof can be presented offline and at any point in the future. For example, the proof could be mailed to a trusted third party, encrypted and signed by an application, only to be opened if needed and authorized.<p>NIST encourages the community at large to research and publish novel ways in which this tool can be used. A few examples of applications are described below:<p><pre><code>    Unpredictable Sampling\n    New Secure Authentication Mechanisms\n    Secure Multi-party Computation\n</code></pre>\nA Quantum Source:<p>Commercially available physical sources of randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently envisioned applications of the Beacon. However, demonstrably unpredictable values are not possible to obtain in any classical physical context. Given this fact, our team established a collaboration with NIST physicists from the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML). The aim is to use quantum effects to generate a sequence of truly random values, guaranteed to be unpredictable, even if an attacker has access to the random source. In August 2012, this project was awarded a multi-year grant from NIST&#x27;s Innovations in Measurement Science (IMS) Program. IMS awards highly competitive projects designed to explore high-risk, leading-edge research concepts that anticipate future measurement and standards needs of industry and science. For more information on this collaboration see <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nist.gov&#x2F;pml&#x2F;div684&#x2F;random_numbers_bell_test.cfm</a>\nLocality-Loophole-Free Bell Test\nA space-time diagram illustrating a locality-loophole-free Bell test. In this test, entangled photons are verified to have correlations that exceed the maximum level possible with any predetermined (or classical) states. To demonstrate this unequivocally, it is important to make sure that the measurements performed on one photon cannot, by any means within the bounds of physics, influence the measurement of the other photon. Such an influence, if it were to exist, could allow fully predetermined states to appear to share quantum correlations. Conducting the two measurements outside of each other&#x27;s light cones ensures this measurement independence. In the space-time diagram above, the speed of light is depicted by rays at ±45 degrees, and also represents the maximum speed at which information about any event could (conceivably) propagate away from the origin of the event. Therefore, positions outside the cone formed by the rays from any event represent locations and times that could not possibly have received any information from the event. In the loophole-free test illustrated above, entangled photons are emitted from the source and propagate in opposite directions towards receivers Alice and Bob. At some point in time, indicated by &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j,&quot; Alice and Bob each independently choose how to measure the properties of the photon each will receive. To conduct a locality-loophole-free Bell test, Alice and Bob must complete their chosen measurements (Ai,and Bj, determining results a and b, respectively.) before any information about the other&#x27;s choice could possibly reach their location; Alice must complete her measurement before the rays emanating from the event &quot;j&quot; intersect her location, similarly Bob must complete his measurement outside the light cone of event &quot;i.&quot; Closing this and other loopholes in the Bell test provide certification that no information about the state of the photons could have been available prior to its observation, assuring that the correlations could not have been predetermined. That guarantee of no predetermination of the photon system and its measurement results, will ultimately be used to produce random bits that can be assured to be both random and unknown to anyone before a certain time.<p>End Date:\nongoing\nLead Organizational Unit:\nitl\nStaff:<p>Rene Peralta\n301-975-8702\nrene.peralta@nist.gov<p>Mike Bartock\nLarry Bassham\nJoshua Bienfang\nHarold Booth\nProf. Michael Fischer \n(Yale University Computer Science Dept)\nScott Glancy\nDr. Michaela Iorga\nStephen Jordan\nJohn Kelsey\nEmanuel Knill\nPaulina Kuo\nYi-Kai Liu\nAlan Migdall\nSae Woo Nam\nAndrew Rukhin\nMurugiah Souppaya\nXiao Tang<p>WARNING:\nDO NOT USE BEACON GENERATED\nVALUES AS SECRET\nCRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS.",

My experiences are purely anecdotal but there seems to be a recurring theme.<p>Note: All Rayovac batteries used were confirmed to be alkaline batteries and the Sunbeam batteries it appears are not alkaline. This may have been the reason for the subpar results I experienced yet I question why the Rayovac alkalines I used produced very similar results to the allegedly non-alkaline Sunbeams.<p>Xbox 360 controller: I&#x27;ve used Sunbeam and Rayovac AA batteries from the dollar store and CVS, respectively. They barely last a week and when I hit the dashboard button to check the state of charge it still shows 2 and sometimes 3 bars but the controller kept disconnecting. Tried 3 other controllers and 3 other battery packs to verify it wasn&#x27;t a controller&#x2F;battery holder problem. Same results. Switched to Duracell and not only do they last almost a month but they go all the way until the battery icon is empty and then they cut out. I now use Energizer rechargeable NiMH batteries and they last almost as long as the duracells but I can swap them out quickly.<p>Paintball marker: I have a relatively high end (it was top of the line back in 2007) paintball marker that I&#x27;d been experiencing problems with where it would turn off in the middle of games. At the time I was, again, using either Sunbeam or Rayovac 9V batteries from the dollar store or CVS. I found an old duracell 9V and tested it. It had about half a charge left, perhaps a little more. I put that in and it went strong for a few months and many games before finally crapping out.<p>Ditto same results for my paintball loader which takes 6 AA batteries or 2 9V batteries. Sunbeam and Rayovac barely worked for a little while but Duracells kept on trucking for a long time.<p>Ham radio: I have an AA adapter pack for my handheld ham radio but this time it was a 3 way comparison with Sunbeam and Rayovac again taking a distant 3rd place, a rechargeable Maha battery taking 1st and Duracells nipping at the heels of the rechargeable battery for signal strength and general usability when I needed it most.<p>All that being said and taking into consideration those experiences, all the smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in the house have Duracells in them as I&#x27;ll be damned if I&#x27;m going to take a chance on the generic batteries again.<p>P.S. I still can&#x27;t convince my mom to buy Duracells as she insists on getting the generic batteries and then keeps complaining to me that dad gets frustrated that the TV remote &quot;doesn&#x27;t work like it used to!&quot; (Note: It had Duracells in it for a while before they finally died and were replaced with...Sunbeams!)",

Minicomputers had that because they couldn&#x27;t afford enough transistors to do mainframe-type channels.  That problem went away a long time ago, but the legacy architecture remains.<p>You need both channels with access control and peripherals designed for channels to make this work without OS intervention.

Time&#x2F;Date [2][3] also are basic datatypes with proper literal form.<p>From Rebol console (these types not yet all implemented in Red):<p><pre><code>  &gt;&gt; red + blue\n  == 255.0.255\n  &gt;&gt; 192.168.100.123 and 255.0.0.0\n  == 192.0.0.0\n  &gt;&gt; yesterday: now&#x2F;date - 24:00\n  == 15-Nov-2014\n  &gt;&gt; in-one-year: now + 365\n  == 16-Nov-2015\n  &gt;&gt; yesterday &lt; in-one-year\n  == true\n</code></pre>\nRebol provides around 55 datatypes, with a good part of them having a specific literal form. The standard library is actually built-in the language, through this rich set of datatypes (each datatype overloads the basic language functions and operators). You don&#x27;t need to &quot;import&quot; any of it, it&#x27;s right there, but almost transparent to the users. The footprint for that is small, the full uncompressed runtime in binary form is about 500KB only.<p>This unusual (but very effective in practice) approach, is one of the features that got me hooked to Rebol in the first place, 15 years ago.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-16.html#section-3.9\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rebol.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;core23&#x2F;rebolcore-16.html#section-3...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-16.html#section-3.2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rebol.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;core23&#x2F;rebolcore-16.html#section-3...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-16.html#section-3.8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rebol.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;core23&#x2F;rebolcore-16.html#section-3...</a>",

  "text": "&gt; How does one take a &quot;Fourier analysis&quot; of a bridge?<p>Give the bridge an &#x27;impulse.  Then it&#x27;s Fourier transform is\nhas all frequencies.  Then see what the bridge does:  Get out\nthe transfer function of the bridge.  It might have\na peak -- then don&#x27;t march the troops at that frequency.\nOr the output motion of the bridge is the inverse\nFourier transform of the Fourier transform of the\ninput to the bridge from the soldiers times the\ntransfer function of the bridge.  If the signal from\nthe soldiers puts too much power at a frequency that is\nhigh in the transfer function, then that is a &quot;resonate\nfrequency&quot; and the bridge is threatened.<p>For the violin, yes, the human ear does a lot of\nFourier analysis with the little hairs inside that\ncoiled up thing, whatever it is called, but for the\nviolin I was considering the beats when bow\ntwo adjacent strings together.  So, bow the\nA string at 440 Hz together with the E string\nat about (3&#x2F;2)440 Hz, and listen to the third\nharmonic of the A string and the second harmonic\nof the E string -- they should be the same\nfrequency.  If their frequencies differ by\nx Hz, then the sound will have amplitude modulations,\n<i>beats</i>, of x per second.  That&#x27;s how a violinist\ntunes the instrument.<p>The Fourier part?  The\nsound from the A string is roughly periodic but\nnot a sine wave.  Similarly for the sound from the\nE string.  Do Fourier analysis, that is, Fourier\nseries on each of the two periodic signals.\nTake the third term from the Fourier series of\nthe A string and the second term from the Fourier\nseries for the E string, and listen to the beats.\nWhile the signals from each string are periodic,\nthey are not sine waves, but the terms from the\nFourier analysis are sine waves which is partly\nwhy the beats are so easy to hear.  So, in effect,\nare using, say, the E string to find the Fourier coefficient\nof the third harmonic of the A string.<p>The A and E strings are separated in frequency by\nan <i>interval</i> of a <i>perfect fifth</i> which is 7\nsemi-tones or, from a piano, about 2^(7&#x2F;12)\nwhich is close to 3&#x2F;2.  Well, that&#x27;s the story for\na perfect fifth.  But there is also a perfect\nfourth, 5 semi-tones, a major third, 4 semi-tones,\nand a minor third, 3 semi-tones, a perfect 6th,\n9 semi-tones, and, of course, an octave, 12\nsemi-tones.  In <i>perfect</i> tuning, each of these\nintervals has, for the two notes, overtones\nwith the same frequency (for two small whole numbers,\none of them times the frequency of the lower\nnote is the same as the other times the frequency\nof the higher note)\nso that can <i>tune</i> the\ninterval by listening to beats.  Of course, the\neasiest one to hear is the octave.<p>So, when\nusing two strings this way, really are doing a\nFourier analysis using one string to take the\nHilbert space inner product of the two signals\nand using a sine wave from one of the overtones\nand its inner product with the other signal\nto <i>scan</i> that signal for beats and, thus,\nwhere the overtones are and, thus, really \ndoing what Fourier analysis does, a projection via\nHilbert space inner products onto orthogonal \naxes (sine waves at the overtone frequencies, that is,\nat frequencies that are whole number multiples, whole\nnumbers again, of the frequency of the original\nperiodic signal).  So, adjust one of the two\nstrings and in effect scan the sound from the other\nstring for it&#x27;s overtones -- that&#x27;s essentially\nFourier analysis.  I will resist writing out all\nthe math, but, really, a lot of Fourier theory is\nfairly intuitive stuff where a lot of the main ideas\ncan be done with just pictures.<p>Or, yes, it would\nbe a little simpler to play just, say, the A string\nand have an audio oscillator that puts out a sine\nwave and, then, slowly sweep the frequency of the\noscillator sine wave and listen for beats with the\nsound of the A string -- that&#x27;s essentially just \nFourier series analysis of the periodic signal of the\nA string.  But if don&#x27;t have an audio oscillator handy,\nand use another string, say, the D or E string,\nand its overtones, each of which is a sine wave,\nand adjust the frequency of the D or E string and,\nthus, <i>sweep</i> a selected (listen carefully!)\novertone of the D or E string past selected overtones\nof the A string and do much the same as with the\naudio oscillator.<p>Gee, I knew there was some Fourier\ntheory in there somewhere!",

More needs to be done.&quot;</i><p>There are a lot of reasons poor people don&#x27;t eat healthier; supply is definitely part of it. But not just supply of food, supply of time as well. A poor person is probably working some physically taxing job and is just too tired to cook a healthy meal. Or too tired to get to the market selling healthy food, or... a million other things. It&#x27;s not just &quot;demand&quot;, it&#x27;s not that they just don&#x27;t want to eat healthy. Some don&#x27;t even know fast food is unhealthy. Don&#x27;t forget, we have people on HN defending fastfood hamburgers..... so imagine the potential confusion about nutrition in a poor &amp; less educated community.",

It doesn&#x27;t have to be a solid tunnel but something that keeps out birds and other debris from the area.

I&#x27;m going to bury this post and ask you all not to post any more of them.\nOnly one account (whoishiring) is allowed to make regular feature posts that we don&#x27;t kill as duplicates. (That&#x27;s for the obvious reason of preventing karma sweepstakes and race conditions.) Should we make this &quot;Idea&quot; thread a regular feature? I&#x27;ve thought about it quite a bit. I think the answer is no.\nExperiments are worth trying, but this one has gone on for a month now and I don&#x27;t think it has cleared the bar [1]. Something about having all these ideas in one place makes the whole less than the sum of its parts. The threads seem to me to have gotten less interesting as they&#x27;ve become more regular.\nI&#x27;m sorry to disappoint those of you who disagree. But our job is to optimize HN for quality and I don&#x27;t think the quality is high enough here. Ideas are better in the wild.

If its a few months or a year or two, it does not matter what the alternative career path is, as long as you do land a job that pays enough for you to support your family. If you are looking for alternate career paths for more than a couple of years, why think of this as temporary? Just switch to a different path and reevaluate when you stop having fun. Check this list to see which of the following helps:<p>1. Take a week or two off. Go on vacation. Maybe you just need a short break.<p>2. Find a new job as a developer. The change in environment (people and&#x2F;or technologies that you work with) may do the trick.<p>3. Switch to a PM role for a while.<p>4. If you think being a developer is no longer fun, consider a career change.<p>Whatever you do, do not wait too long for the problem to fix itself.

It looks like the maiden voyage of that test train was 2002 and it is still not a &quot;production&quot; train, no doubt owing to the challenges of putting a maglev train into production.<p>But the article wasn&#x27;t about &quot;maglev trains&quot; in general, it was about a specific one. And so the comparison is moot except to compare how each system has approached the challenges of building and&#x2F;or productizing such fast trains.<p>When I read your comments I felt like it was a Chinese boast&#x2F;Japanese putdown not an actual comment. As I understand it there is some animosity between Japan and China, and with that understanding it felt to me that your comments were simply being mean rather than adding to the conversation.<p>So given that you have first hand experience with the Shanghai train, do you have any insight into what has kept it from being deployed into a production capacity? Articles like this one in Time (<a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/travel/cityguide/article/0,31489,1851908_1851830_1851792,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.time.com&#x2F;time&#x2F;travel&#x2F;cityguide&#x2F;article&#x2F;0,3148...</a>) portray it as a sort of entertainment ride, like a roller coaster might be in an amusement park.",

Fiction can easily establish itself as a reference point for future ideas, such as on AI.<p>The thing about rich worlds full of counterfactual events is that, being completely unrealistic, they have no influence on real life.  There&#x27;s a reason the people who accomplish big things in real life usually spent a lot more of their time reading textbooks than novels.<p>If you want to raise artificial intelligence as an example, the very ridiculousness of the body of fictional evidence from which to generalize has probably set back the field by <i>decades</i>, because people keep running around chasing nonsense ideas out of the sorry imaginations of philosophers of mind and science-fiction writers rather than following the obvious research leads that stare into the face of anyone who bothers to <i>actually look</i> with a clear head.<p>But I&#x27;m sure that anyone complaining about how speculative fiction is <i>dangerous</i> would probably say the opposite: that giving people bad models to work from somehow makes them <i>more</i> likely to discover real, working science.<p>Anyway, point being, the thing about having movies where pandimensional posthumans open wormholes to save mankind from omnivirulent crop blight is that they don&#x27;t make space exploration dangerous.",

He has said that numerous times.<p>2) Prior to Obama&#x27;s election, it didn&#x27;t have all the tech companies lined up into XKeyscore. That was put into place on his watch.<p>3) The NSA also was not yet illegally tapping into and stealing bulk data from these companies via interception, to get around collection restraints.<p>4) The NSA&#x27;s massive Utah data center was built during his Administration.<p>5) In 2009 Obama&#x27;s DOJ admitted to illegal surveillance abuses, and claimed steps had been taken to correct such. They lied of course, they did the exact opposite: they massively expanded surveillance.<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/us/16nsa.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;us&#x2F;16nsa.html</a><p>6) The U.S. Marshals Service overflight program came into existence during Obama&#x27;s Administration. The service was initiated in 2007, and the flight program was put into place by the Obama Administration. Worth noting: he also didn&#x27;t stop it, he expanded the program.<p>7) The NSA began actively helping other agencies illegally (eg the DEA), via parallel construction, during Obama&#x27;s Administration. This practice has massively expanded under Obama&#x27;s watch.<p>9) Obama also loves to use the Espionage Act to persecute journalists that act to reveal the dirt of his Administration.<p>10) The Obama Administration continued to lie about the programs. The Obama Administration continued to refuse to admit their existence. The Obama Administration massively expanded all surveillance programs. This is all continuing right now.<p>11) During Obama&#x27;s watch, the Stingray device has gone from being a piece of military technology, to being handed down from the Federal level to the local and state level. During his Administration, efforts have been made to expand illegal surveillance from the domain of the Federal Government, and to ensure widespread surveillance at all levels, so the Feds have a greater total access to communications.<p>There has never been a more abusive surveillance President in US history. And there are another easy dozen items on this list, of abuses by the Obama Presidency when it comes to surveillance.",

While this does get labeled as &quot;used&quot; memory, it can very quickly be freed up by the operating system by evicting this cached data back to disk if that memory is needed elsewhere.<p>This can make Linux appear more memory-hungry, but in actuality a better description might be that Linux is more effectively using the resources at its disposal. I&#x27;m not saying that this is what&#x27;s happening in this case, but it&#x27;s a possibility.",

  "text": "You seem to be saying that men were not prosecuted merely for being gay men or just for having consensual sex with other adult men in private, and that the men must have been having sex with children[1] or in public.<p>Thousands of men each year were arrested and locked up.  Police were acting as agent provocateurs (thus entrapping these men) so obviously many of those prosecutions involve sexual activity in public -- where that&#x27;s defined as &quot;being approached by a police officer acting as a gay man and having a conversation with that officer&quot;.<p>You appear to be applying stricter standards of conduct to gay men than to heterosexual people.  We can see very many convictions of gay men for gross indecency in public.  But this definition of &quot;public&quot; included (until the year 2000) anywhere where a third person may be present - two adult men in one of their homes would have been having sex in public if one of those homes was rented lodgings; this was an additional restriction on gay sex that heterosexual couples didn&#x27;t face.  This extra restriction was included in law in 1968, and overturned in 2000.<p>Finally, around younger people: laws for heterosexuals had the age of female consent at 16 for heterosexual sex.  But for gay men the age of consent was 21.  Thus a 25 year old man having sex with a 16 year old woman was fine, but a 25 year old man having sex with a 20 year old man would be arrested and imprisoned.<p>[1] children need to be protected from sexual predators.  Suggesting that gay men are more likely to be sexual predators is not supported by any evidence and is a homophobic slur that needs to end.",

They can get users to any of their products. But, it is true that these products are not usually very lock-in. Search is very easy to switch from. Gmail is pretty easy.

For example, here I can generate code corresponding to a given factorial, and also muck with it.<p><pre><code>    &gt; (define (fact-code n)\n        (if (= n 0) 1 `(* ,n ,(fact-code (- n 1)))))\n    &gt; (fact-code 4)\n    (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1)))\n    &gt; (eval (fact-code 4) (the-environment))\n    24\n    &gt; (eval (replace &#x27;* &#x27;+ (fib-code 4)) (the-environment))\n    10\n</code></pre>\nWe can write a function similar to <i>fact-code</i> in Rebol, which I&#x27;m borrowing from an earlier comment[^1]<p><pre><code>  &gt;&gt; fact-code: func [n] [either n = 1 [1] [compose [(n) * (fact-code n - 1)]]]\n  \n  &gt;&gt; fact-code 4\n  == [4 * 3 * 2 * 1]\n  \n  &gt;&gt; do fact-code 4\n  == 24\n\n  &gt;&gt; do replace&#x2F;all fact-code 4 &#x27;* &#x27;+\n  == 10\n</code></pre>\nThere is no analogous way of generating and manipulating JavaScript code using JavaScript.

However, overall JavaScript does not afford good programming practices and does not cleanly expose important re-usable programming concepts. Between the good parts of JavaScript, there are nasty surprises.<p>I think python is a good first language for a few reasons.<p>1. Overall the syntax is clean, concise, and readable in the sense that the actual code can be close to &quot;sudo&quot; code, or that it is somewhat similar to what what you might encounter in a mathematics class.<p>2. From Wikipedia:<p>&quot;Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.&quot;<p>All of those programming paradigms are important to understand and few languages capture all of them as nicely as python. Also, static typing and memory management are important to understand – yet, mostly distracting while learning a first language. Python removes the distraction.<p>3. Python&#x27;s strict white space rules will force you maintain a somewhat consistent code style – something that many new programmers are awful at.<p>This list is not exhaustive, just some thoughts.",

This paper (the famous Bennett and Brassard, 1984 protocol, a.k.a. BB84):<p><a href=\"http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bennetc/BB84highest.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;researcher.watson.ibm.com&#x2F;researcher&#x2F;files&#x2F;us-bennetc...</a><p>This is quantum physics.  Look at where it was published.  Proceedings for a CPSC conference in Bangalore.  Bangalore!  This paper started an entire field that entire departments at multiple universities are devoted to now. If it hadn&#x27;t been so radical at the time it would have made it into a high impact journal.  Instead, IEEE conference proceedings, Bangalore.<p>I went through grad-school in this field. This paper started it all so, needless to say, I wanted to see an original copy of it.  <i>I never found one</i>.  These conference proceedings were not widely distributed. People passed around copies of copies of copies and there were, of course, reprints in other publications. I had to borrow a book that included this paper as a chapter from my supervisor, and that wasn&#x27;t long ago.  The only reason I was able to read this field-creating paper was because, even though the peer-reviewed journals that should have jumped at the chance to publish this work balked, other people recognized something good in it. Today, a pdf of the original is linked to by Wikipedia.<p>How much bold, radical, totally unpublishable (in any respectable journal) work is out there waiting to be dusted off and used to start new fields of study?  BB84 could have slipped through the cracks.  It&#x27;s a safe bet that other such work actually did go unnoticed. We can only stand on the backs of those who came before us if we can access their work. I don&#x27;t know if what we&#x27;re experiencing today is an information <i>revolution</i>, but I&#x27;m willing to bet, in a few decades time, we&#x27;ll be able to look back on the march of scientific progress and see a huge boost in research productivity when our ability to distribute and search through existing research started to catch up to the pace of its production.",

Motorbike saddles, tarpaulins, seats and cushions are things I produce when tired from coding. Hand crafted quality sells well, and builds up a customer base that is even more loyal then a mainframe service contract.<p>Especially the biker scene has the tendency of regular up or outs. Some bikers move up, others move out, when ever a club closes, or is patched over. Same happens to good quality saddles also. So even if you do not sell to the Angles right now, they will might ride your saddles in 10 or 20 years, and they will be top paying customers.<p>Same same but different with sailing boats. Even if one can not move a tarpaulin from one boat to an other, like you could do with a Harley saddle, the sailors themself move up or out regular. They either buy a bigger boat, or quit sailing. Selling quality ensures a loyal customer, who tells his club.<p>You&#x27;ll soon be invaded by wanna be customers every winter, if done right. Do not take to many, keep it to a maximum of 2-3 month of 20 hours work per week. Some of the sailing club customers might even become software customers next summer.",

If I open more than a few tabs (70 say, with FF I can do an order of magnitude more) in Chrome it maxes out on memory to the point of the system becoming useless. Funnily enough it actually maxes out on swap space even though there is RAM available and then starts thrashing like crazy. Setting swappiness alleviates this somewhat but not entirely. Its a box with 1 GB ram + 1 GB swap. Not big by current standards, but has more than plenty RAM in my opinion if it werent for the tendency to write bloatware these days.<p>Yeah I could get some more RAM, but this box is a good testbed for software with a leaner streak, bloat does not excite me as much, sorry. Funnily enough this seems to offend a whole lot of people, as if I owe it to them to have more RAM on my m&#x2F;c. It is probably worth it just for that amusement.<p>Definitely interested in giving *BSD a shot. The thing that has stopped me so far is the difficulty in sharing data between them.<p>EDIT @DanBC<p>&gt; 70 tabs is not normal and 700 is just, well, weird.<p>So I have been told :)<p>Firefox manages it well enough though, I would assume Dillo would too.

(Incidentally, this is a problem which is not going to get solved even if everyone switched to open-access venues today.)<p>Just a comment though: not all citations are equal, so just counting them is quite a crude metric. For instance, a lot of citations in my field (theoretical CS) are &quot;attribution citations&quot; that point the reader to the original paper that introduced a concept or proved a result; and these are not the same as citations of work that you actually extend, or to which you compare.<p>As in theoretical CS things progress fast and people usually improve upon fairly recent works, my feeling (not backed up by data) is that most citations of work older than 10 years are attribution citations; and for attribution, you don&#x27;t really need to have read the original paper, you just need to know what it introduced or proved. So maybe the Web is making it easier to look up older papers and cite them, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that the older paper will influence your research beyond adding a bibliographical entry.<p>You could say those additional cites may be useful to the reader, but even then, readers unfamiliar with a concept would often do better to find a recent survey about the concept, rather than try to understand the original paper that introduced it. (The original paper is usually hard to read because it is old and language and notation have changed; and people probably didn&#x27;t have a good understanding of the concept when they introduced it.) So those citations are mostly for courtesy.",

I hope to think they&#x27;re a small minority of people but it&#x27;s amazing how many women they&#x27;ve tried to turn off tech with their idiocy, their defamation, their death threats and their abuse.<p>When I see what happens to women in tech and a lot of the abuse they have to withstand, I admire those that can stand the trolls. I don&#x27;t think I would be this resilient faced with this abuse.<p>I wish we could be in a world where everybody would be accepted in the tech community regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. I hoped before that due to the relatively higher education level of tech workers, people would be more tolerant but it seems that&#x27;s not the case.<p>PS: Now, in the case of weev and his AT &amp; T conviction, I of course support reversing it and support the work that EFF is doing defending him but that&#x27;s despite weev.

But when it doesn&#x27;t work right you will go crazy trying to work out why.<p>To be good with JavaScript you need a rather substantial and solid grasp of CS fundamentals and how they are implemented in languages that are stricter about what they will accept and how.<p>In JavaScript there are too many situations where it either does something totally unexpected (well actually totally logical, but you need to know some pretty arcane stuff to see it that way) or it just fails silently or less likely with a terse exception.<p>For a beginning programmer that is very little feedback to help with overcoming the initial roadblock. Sometimes called the &quot;getting helloworld to run problem&quot;.  Trying to learn JS in a browser context is made even more difficult because you need to grapple with the DOM - it is not easy to grok at the best of times.<p>If you decide to ignore the advice in this and the other posts and go ahead learning JavaScript as the first language, then I suggest getting a very good introductory book and perhaps using Developer JavaScript Console.  The debugger is good in that you can single step code and watch variables as they change.  You will probably need to take copious notes to understand what is going on.<p>To be a competent programmer is more than learning a language, it requires a solid foundation in computer science and software engineering.  Whilst these topics can be learnt from a book, most people need guidance from those who have acquired such knowledge.  Whether they can be bothered answering newbie&#x27;s questions is another matter.",

Polyester (78%) and acrylic (22%) made most of the difference.<p>* Effluent from sewage treatment plants was tested, and contained similar proportions of polyester (67%), acrylic (17%) and polyamide (16%). They state that this suggests fibers at shores and disposal sites are mainly derived from sewer through washing clothes.<p>* Proportions of fibers used in textiles are: 78% polyester, 9% polyamide, 7% polypropylene, 5% acrylic. Again, these proportions are similar.<p>* Because people wear more clothes in winter, and wash 7 times as often, they expect more fibers in sewage in winter than in summer, but did so far not test it.",

Tried another with that previous doctor and got orthostatic hypotension, then with this doctor tried an anticonvulsant, which I had to stop because of bad skin side effects (still have little bright red flecks on my skin here and there).  At that point, especially with the very slow ramp up of the anticonvulsant (meaning for a long while I didn&#x27;t have a therapeutic dose), we crossed our fingers and stopped trying mood stabilizers, which lead to the change in diagnosis.  (Elsewhere in this topic I mention how I later started taking a low dose of another antipsychotic to deal with anxiety in general, with very useful side effects for insomnia and allergies.)<p>I did name one drug name because if any other atypical anti-psychotic will do the trick it should perhaps be tried, Zyprexa is pretty infamous for weight gain among other things.",

One can master the language without too much pain, and you end up having much more control on what you are actually doing (there&#x27;s little chance a line of code does not do what you read from it... while in C++ you may have hidden behavior behind even the simpler operation such a + or *).<p>Secondly, and this is probably a matter of taste, C++11&#x27;s lambdas are just awfully designed. Their syntax overloads, with a totally different meaning, some tokens such as []. As in many situations, C++ design committee tends to chose the most complicate possible design, without taking readability into account (maybe conciseness is the main goal of their syntax choices?). On the other, the blocks syntax makes is very clear you are dealing with a function-like object with very similar syntax. The choice was made to have a clean and readable syntax.<p>Third point, C++11 just didn&#x27;t exist in 2009. There were drafts but support from compilers was just nascent. RHEL in 2009 was at version 6 (very young release) which ships with GCC 4.4 (and GCC 4.7 as an experimental toolchain). The most common RHEL was version 5 with GCC 4.1. RHEL officially supports C++11 since RHEL 7 which ships with GCC 4.8 and was release on June 2014.",

  "text": "Quite late here, and I wish I had more time to comment.  I guess the main point to make is the assertions about effects on serotonin&#x2F;dopamine systems of higher altitude locations, and effects of these messenger chemicals on mood&#x2F;cognition are vast oversimplifications of very complex multiple system interactions.<p>To begin with, in important respects characterizing 5HT&#x2F;DA as &quot;neurotransmitters&quot; is not quite accurate.  Certainly 5HT and DA play diverse roles in the brain and elsewhere, but often act as <i>modulators</i> of neuronal firing patterns rather than primary signal transmission itself.  Hence not necessarily &quot;excitatory&quot; or &quot;inhibitory&quot; in a direct sense.  Something like a gate in an FET modulating current flow between source and drain.<p>We usually think of glutamate as the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and GABA being inhibitory, but it&#x27;s not a clean separation, since there can be a range of effects on subsets of receptors.<p>Furthermore, 5HT, DA, and a host of other monamines and peptides have complex interactions to up- or downregulate transmission in neuronal circuits.<p>It may be true that there are correlations among variables of altitude, suicide, or even attentional disorders.  However, not only does correlation not imply causality, it&#x27;s especially ambiguous when there is a potentially unlimited range of contributors, perhaps far too many to factor in to the results.<p>For instance, I live in Oregon where around 90% of the population lives in the Willamette Valley, essentially at sea-level elevation.  Yet according to the graphics in the article, Oregon has a high (but not the highest) rate of depression and suicidal behavior, known issues to be sure.<p>We do suffer other conditions like substantially northern latitude, widespread Vitamin D insufficiency, economic stresses, and other factors to take into account.<p>Perhaps the work described in the article could generate some interesting hypotheses, but painting with such a broad brush seems overstating the case and likely to be misleading.",

With RandR enabled, what you’ll see is 2 connected outputs, and all applications will treat them as such, even though you have only one monitor connected.<p>Fixing this requires changes in RandR (i.e. the X server) and each driver.

So to provide the backhaul for upstream bandwidth we will do deep reach into the datacentre &lt;-&gt; home and interconnect in the data centre. Therefore fttp will not provide p2p connectivity unless there is a need for local connectivity because deepreach and datacentre networking is rendered non viable by sheer traffic volume. But the traffic will need to be geographically localised and&#x2F;or the services will have to provide the economic support for backhaul uplift.<p>I think we can probably do petabits on single mode fibre bundles now with the right boxes  but the trick is the right boxes, which are spensive and take lots of electricity to run. So even if you can pony up for an FTTP roll out then the use cases are going to be constrained by the network architecture that is used to support it.<p>Now, for most people this is not a problem as the up channel is basically irrelevant in terms of bandwidth in the current consumer internet, but if you are the sort of person who imagines a decentralised and democratic consumer internet which is not mediated by massive supernational companies, or if you are the sort of person who is interested in where the  value is captured in the industry value chain I think this does matter.<p>Sharing other peoples content will not fund a democratic internet even if governments fund and regulate fttp. We need a new class of applications that generate revenue sufficient to pay for the infrastructure that will facilitate them. If we get that then the infrastructure will also facilitate a shift away from the data centre (not it&#x27;s elimination though as it will be the way that the current usecases are delivered)<p>If you have any ideas please write them up - before the industry dies!",

Most sane ISPs won&#x27;t do this with routers on their network which serve multiple people - it&#x27;s a fault if they&#x27;re over capacity (unless they intentionally want it, eg. ISPs vs Netflix).<p>If you&#x27;ve got little or no control over the device your ISP sends you - there are ways around it. Either turn off WiFi (or don&#x27;t connect to it), connect a single OpenWrt or CeroWrt router to that over ethernet and get all devices to connect to that router instead. You&#x27;ll probably need to fiddle around with it to avoid double NAT (eg. setup the OpenWrt router in the DMZ of your ISP router if you can).<p>Personally I&#x27;ve stuck with OpenWrt - it works just fine.

Hopefully it&#x27;ll more useful than &quot;serotonin = happy,&quot; but it&#x27;ll probably contains errors. Corrections and additional information would be greatly appreciated!<p>My GP prescribed two drugs at the same time: citalopram, an SSRI, to treat depression, and hydroxyzine as a sleep aid.<p>I thought that was interesting because hydroxyzine is a 5HT-2a  antagonist, which seemed like it&#x27;d interfere with the SSRI. It took quite a bit of digging to learn that it probably wouldn&#x27;t, which still surprises me.<p>My current understanding is SSRIs play a long game—at first, the lower reuptake rate extends serotonin&#x27;s effect in synapses (but specific subtypes, because boosting the wrong ones makes you puke), but then autoreceptors (feedback mechanism for the transmitting neuron) undo that by causing less serotonin to be transmitted in the first place. But then, eventually they reset, and then the other end of the synapse gets to down-regulate its sensitivity to serotonin, at which point the SSRI&#x27;s done its actual job.<p>But the reading I did didn&#x27;t leave me thinking researchers are terribly confident that that&#x27;s a complete explanation.<p>It would explain the side-effect profile though—especially the absurd increase in anxiety. Treatment is increasing 5HT-2a activity, apparently intentionally, when another drug is a potent anxiolytic blocking 5HT-2a activity. I quit taking the hydroxyzine, but while I was taking it it seemed to be an SSRI side effect off switch. It also made me a zombie the whole next day, which is why I stopped taking it.<p>And of course, the biggest thing I learned: don&#x27;t let the drugs be alone in their battle against depression. Odds of successful treatment are much better with the combination of drugs and therapy.",

It was hard to get a read from just that one sentence with the word kernel emphasized.<p>&gt; (Do audio devices support floating point formats nowadays?)<p>Natively, no. You can be lazy and do it anyway in software mixing though.<p>&gt; I just find it amusing how a monolithic design of doing all audio stuff in the kernel is held up by some as an example of reliability and as superior to a more modular design that is more in line with the UNIX philosophy.<p>Certainly, it would be ideal if everything non-critical were in user space. But audio in the kernel is probably at the <i>very bottom</i> of the list. Audio mixing is maybe 0.0001% of the kernel code, and is some of the safest, simplest arithmetic code imaginable. It&#x27;s worrying about the one ant you saw on the counter when your entire house is infested with termites.<p>&gt; About the KMS however, I&#x27;ve heard that DisplayPort link training has latency requirements that are difficult to meet in anything but a kernel interrupt handler<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or not, but I am running a DisplayPort monitor (ZR30w) now without KMS, and it works fine. Obviously the video driver is still running in kernel mode, but at least it&#x27;s a module outside of the kernel itself that runs after my system is booted.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to see is distros and vendors instead relying on UEFI GOP for boot-time mode setting.<p>&gt; Also X servers have traditionally needed direct PCI bus access to get the hardware initialized<p>Well, compare it to audio. Eventually even a userland mixer will have to send the samples through some sort of hardware interface. But if your goal is stability, then it would be ideal to get as much code out of the kernel as possible.<p>&gt; and to what extent due to actual technical limitations and additional complexity of a microkernel architecture.<p>Certainly nothing is ever perfect. There are so many potential problems with computers. Cosmic rays can flip bits in your RAM if you don&#x27;t shell out an extra $500 for the premium CPU, mainboard and ECC RAM. Strong enough power surges (lightning) can burn through and destroy absolutely any running computing equipment. Hardware can literally fail and take down your system. Things can overheat, there can be design flaws in the silicon itself, etc.<p>So I look at it like OpenBSD looks at security. You want to stack all the protections you can. Mirror your drives, use ECC RAM, don&#x27;t run anything in kernel space you don&#x27;t have to, try and build as much redundancy and safety as you can into the system. It won&#x27;t be perfect, but every bit will help increase uptime.<p>...<p>So again, sure, audio should preferably be in user space. Just, it&#x27;s many thousands of times worse that video isn&#x27;t even trying to do this, and is in fact going in the opposite direction to become <i>more</i> tightly coupled with the kernel.",

  "text": "I agree that it is reasonable for people to disagree with their company being characterized as misogynistic. However, I continue to believe that responding to reasonable accusations of sexism by spinning elaborate fantasies of revenge against a woman could reasonably be taken as further evidence of sexism. (I also believe that it&#x27;s deeply improper to try to keep journalists from journalism: the First Amendment includes press because they are a foundational part of a functioning democracy. But that&#x27;s mostly beside the point here.)<p>Do I believe that one can in good faith believe that current concerns about sexism are a witch hunt? (Note that &quot;hysteria&quot; is an unfortunate word choice here in that it was an imaginary disease used to smear women for centuries, and the name itself is rooted in the notion that having lady parts makes you crazy.) Sure, I guess. In the same sense that I think one can have a good-faith belief that anthropogenic climate change isn&#x27;t real. In both cases I think some are consciously acting in bad faith. But I think the bulk just don&#x27;t know enough about the topic to have a valid opinion, so they run with the one that&#x27;s politically and&#x2F;or personally convenient for them to have.<p>As a guy, I get it: the shift from thousands of years of male domination to something more equitable feels like a loss. We quite literally didn&#x27;t have to think about how women would take things. Now suddenly our speech and actions are having consequences they didn&#x27;t used to have. It&#x27;s easy to feel that we get in trouble for saying &quot;normal&quot; things. But it didn&#x27;t work the other way: women always had to be conscious of how men would take what they said.<p>The system of beliefs and behaviors that punished women for speaking up and speaking out is on the wane, but as we see with Kathy Sierra, it&#x27;s still powerful. Until it&#x27;s destroyed, I think everybody has an obligation to help end it, or at least stay out of the way. And when people do things that look a lot like supporting and continuing that system (as Michael did here) they should not be surprised when people do not look charitably upon that.",

  "text": "I came up with such a format (called BML) and for the same reasons. Here&#x27;s an example that shows the entirety of the syntax:<p><pre><code>    server\n      path: &#x2F;core&#x2F;www&#x2F;\n      host: example.com\n      port: 80\n      service: true\n      proxy\n        host: proxy.example.com\n        port: 8080\n        authentication: plain\n      description\n        :Primary web-facing server\n        :Provides commerce-related functionality\n    \n    server\n      ...\n      proxy host=&quot;proxy.example.com&quot; port=&quot;8080&quot;\n        authentication: plain\n</code></pre>\nEverything is a node, which can have a data value and zero or more child nodes. Nesting is determined by counting the number of indentions. It uses a counter so that if you want indents to be one tab, or two spaces, or four spaces, it will still work. (Being too rigid here makes the syntax very unfun for humans to write.)<p>Once parsed, element-style (first proxy node) or attribute-style (second proxy node) become identical nodes and are treated the same (but with a flag in case you want to write out a modified file): they are fully interchangeable, so no attribute vs element debates, just use what works best for readability. (This really is critical. Some document types would be ten times as long without attribute-style nodes.)<p>The syntax has no entities. <i>foo=&quot;data&quot;</i> can capture any data that doesn&#x27;t need quotes or newlines. <i>foo:</i> can capture any data that doesn&#x27;t need a newline. <i>foo\\n:data\\n:data</i> can capture any data that doesn&#x27;t need binary. <i>foo\\n:base64\\n:base64</i> can capture absolutely anything.<p>Node names must be [A-Za-z0-9-.]{1,}, and are case-sensitive. The same node name can appear multiple times at any level, even at the root level. Ambiguity is resolved by the order of appearance for each node.<p>The data values of nodes are completely unparsed by the markup. The syntax knows no difference between strings, integers, floats, booleans, binary data, arrays, etc. The application parses the text however it wants. The library adds some convenience functions (.text() to strip surrounding whitespace, .integer() to get a number, .boolean() to decode true&#x2F;yes&#x2F;on vs false&#x2F;no&#x2F;off, etc.)<p>File format is mandatory UTF-8 (no BOM.) Preferred line feeds are &#x27;\\n&#x27;, but &#x27;\\r\\n&#x27; is also permitted because Microsoft.<p>The implementation in C is about 8KB. Since everything has a marker, allocations are not necessary for the node names&#x2F;values (but you will need to allocate the tree structure, obviously.) There&#x27;s an accompanying path query syntax (ala XPath) that&#x27;s another 6KB of code or so.<p>(All the edge cases are well-defined (mismatched indentation, mixing multi-line and child nodes, etc), but the post is getting a bit long.)<p>This was the best I could do at minimalism. Removing any functionality it has results in ruling out many use cases.",

I now have to find someone willing to buy it. The spread alone guarantees I&#x27;m not going to get $1 for it.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve always referred to market cap, never accounting.<p>Not true. Which is why my next test question was going to be: the company went public at $10 last year before dropping to $1. So there&#x27;s $190 in shareholder&#x27;s equity against 100 shares and $90 cash on hand. Market opens, what&#x27;s the price?<p>The core flaw of your argument is that the company can&#x27;t control the market price. So there&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;neutral market cap&quot; transaction that changes the number of shares and you certainly can&#x27;t &quot;undo&quot; it just because the numbers line up on the balance sheet.

  "text": "The most intriguing part of FreeBSD (any BSD really) from an outsider&#x27;s perspective is the fact that &quot;the FreeBSD project&quot; has a bigger, more directed scope than &quot;the Linux project&quot; or &quot;the GNU project&quot;. It&#x27;s a kernel and userland all in one, and they can actually <i>decide</i> to focus more on unity of configuration files and mobility. I get the impression that cannot decide that as efficiently on Linux at all.<p>People often say &quot;Linux is all about choice&quot; as if it&#x27;s a good thing [1]. I think this overwhelming focus on choice really is what&#x27;s so frustrating about Linux and its community. If needs aren&#x27;t being catered to, or if there are disagreements, the amount of vitriol that gets thrown around is despicable. The systemd controversy is so terribly shameful, but lo and behold: FreeBSD now seems to be envious of it (or at least some of its aspects). Gnome 3 is widely regarded [2] as the best, well-integrated desktop environment Linux has ever had, and look at the amount of vitriol <i>that</i> got for having a direction and making choices for the user. I personally think that the level of integration systemd and Gnome 3 are attempting to pioneer make Linux far more attractive than ever, but the Linux community really alienates me with its attitude towards that. With this attitude, desktop Linux mostly remains a patched together collection of software. The rough edges of this patchwork are still far more apparent on even the best regarded distros when compared to OS X or Windows or even Android.<p>It&#x27;s a shame FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t maintain an integrated or official graphical interface. Since it uses the same not-so-well integrated desktops as Linux does, it unfortunately means that using FreeBSD is only a minor improvement over Linux for me in daily use. That means I&#x27;ll just leave Apple to build me a well-working and well-integrated operating system. If an operating system project or vendor makes (good) choices for me, I consider that a big advantage.<p>[1]: I know what the good things about choice are, I&#x27;m trying to make a point.<p>[2]: Widely regarded does not mean &quot;universally regarded&quot; or even &quot;regarded as such by the majority&quot;.",

  "text": "To add some more details - being a good manager can be a delicate dance.  When you are a manager, you start to become responsible for high level tasks that have huge impact to a company.  However, if you micromanage too much, you create an awful culture of fear and hamper developer productivity.<p>So how do you inspire developers to execute in a timeframe dictated by others?  You have to be a leader who inspires the engineers to complete the task, even if it requires putting in extra hours.  This means setting the example, looking out for your engineers&#x27; welfare, being able to provide answers and not problems, and being someone who can be easily approached.<p>The moment something goes wrong, the burden is on the manager to make the right decision - the wrong decision can have negative ramifications over months, if not years.  The moment you micromanage, something is broken in your process, or with the people involved.<p>I recently had to start wearing a technical lead &amp; director hat - the intense pressure of the startup world bore down on my whole team in order to get a working product in order from scratch in about 1 1&#x2F;2 months of coding.  The resources became scarce since the technical lead got sick &amp; had a family death, while two other senior engineers had babies in the time period.  It then was left to two junior developers and me to do the lion&#x27;s share of work until the other engineers could get back to work.  I let the junior engineers work mostly normal hours (until close to our deadline) - I ended up taking the burden largely on myself, with mostly 75 hour weeks (even after the other engineers were back as well).  During regular hours, I did some work, but was more focused on mentorship and any tasks that were blockers.  The early and late hours were when I busted out complex code.<p>At the engineering level, good management shows as incredibly important, especially for startups.  Pressure deadlines on engineers are taxing for all - good management by top level engineers is vital for preventing burnout in everyone else, which can make it easy for people to decide to leave a company, especially when compounded by salary that does not match what the free market has to offer.",

Obviously you will specify something else, but the point was that I&#x27;m used to specifying exactly what else I want, so I have that habit to break&#x2F;relearn.<p>The point you ignored or missed is that as a Linux user with no BSD exposure there&#x27;s a basic difference in philosophy that creates several kinds of tradeoffs that I find compelling and interesting. I&#x27;m not &quot;bringing up&quot; anything in terms of absolute pros and cons, I&#x27;m highlighting what I consider noteworthy differences in terms of <i>learning</i> more about things I have not used.",

The philosophy is to make as many errors happen at runtime rather than &quot;compile&quot; time so that you can continue to work with out always having to satisfy the type checker across your whole program. This is one of the productivity advantages of dynamically typed languages. We feel that the combination of dynamic types and checked mode gives you the best of both worlds.",

What&#x27;s really lacking is a compelling alternative.  The most vocal opposition have made anonymous web sites, have made tons of noise but done very very little in the way of actually solving the problem,  many even refuse to acknowledge them.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to think it&#x27;s a civil war of sorts but the reality is it&#x27;s mostly just a very vocal group that are against it, and FWIW, they don&#x27;t seem to contribute that much.  The BSD world has had it&#x27;s share of these too, it&#x27;s just a more dramatic fork when you startup OpenBSD project or NetBSD or DragonFly or one of the more minor forks.<p>Openness means you get to see the bad as well as the good,  the decision.

  "text": "Like others have said, being unbiased is difficult, but I&#x27;ll try. First, Linux v FreeBSD is really tough, so I will instead approach this from Debian v FreeBSD.<p>I really like how easy Debian on the desktop is: install it, apt-get install xfce, and I have a nice desktop. It&#x27;s very easy to add Adobe Flash, Steam, Skype, etc.<p>The FreeBSD desktop isn&#x27;t as nice. You can add things like Flash and Skype on FreeBSD, but you have to fight harder and often use the Linux emulator. We&#x27;re missing nouveau, I&#x27;ve had some kernel panics with the nvidia binary drivers (caused by nvidia&#x27;s own shoddy code, not FreeBSD&#x27;s fault), there&#x27;s a lot of missing and unstable features due to developers primarily targeting Linux these days (Thunar&#x27;s file refresh is glitchy and often fails to update, Thunar volman only really works with udev&#x2F;Linux, mousepad crashes when you open a file an even multiple of 4KiB due to a bug in their code and a quirk of Linux mmap, livbte-based terminals tend to crash sometimes when you open them due to a bug somewhere between libvte and FreeBSD&#x27;s &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh, file-roller explodes when you try and extract large archives, Firefox has freezing issues with loading gigantic images unless you set MOZ_DISABLE_IMAGE_OPTIMIZE=1 in your environment, on and on.)<p>And it&#x27;s also not really configured well out of the box for the desktop. I have to make this org.freedesktop.consolekit.pkla file and add entries to it in order to get the restart and shutdown buttons in Xfce to work. I have to create a fontconfig&#x2F;fonts.conf file and substitute Helvetica with Sans in order to get Firefox to anti-alias text on web pages. And so on.<p>You are also doing all the setup from scratch. You install xorg, you install your video drivers, you set up xorg.conf, you create .xinitrc, you install a display manager if you want one, etc. This is both good and bad. It&#x27;s great if you love tweaking your system, it&#x27;s bad if you just want to throw it on a box and run it.<p>Moving on ... I really, really appreciate Debian&#x27;s branches. If you install Wheezy, you can get security updates for packages, but not get version bumps. With FreeBSD, you have to choose between &quot;the packages made at release time&quot;, or &quot;the absolute bleeding edge.&quot; These updates can and do break workflows, especially on the desktop (Firefox pushed Australis on me, ibus moved to this braindead, slow-as-molasses super+space IME changer, etc.) The actual package installs are about the same for binary (apt-get vs pkg), but I much prefer FreeBSD&#x27;s ports for building software (which is great when you need to patch software bugs.)<p>But if you&#x27;re patient and good at fixing problems, you can end up with a rock-solid desktop. And hey, maybe PC-BSD will save you all of the above steps, too. I kind of look at FreeBSD vs PC-BSD as I do Debian vs Ubuntu: I&#x27;d rather know how things work than have it all done for me.<p>In terms of features, I really like FreeBSD&#x27;s ZFS, even though it does eat a lot of RAM. Snapshots, whole-disk encryption on root, encrypted swap, mirroring&#x2F;striping&#x2F;RAID even across different disks, easy resilvering, etc. I also really like pf a whole lot more than iptables, as I find the syntax a whole lot more readable and flexible, although I will lament that FreeBSD&#x27;s pf ships with ALTQ (QoS) off by default. I prefer the base system being maintained by the FreeBSD team. I like the consistency, the minimalism, and the great documentation.<p>Whenever I spot a difference between FreeBSD and Linux, I almost always favor the former&#x27;s design: &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random behavior, jails vs cgroups, SO_NOSIGPIPE socket flag (instead of needing MSG_NOSIGNAL), etc.<p>I like that FreeBSD avoids a lot of the &#x27;licensing wars&#x27; BS of Linux. I have Firefox instead of Iceweasel, I have cdrtools instead of cdrkit (I continue to this day to have issues with burning on Linux), I have ZFS instead of btrfs, and just in general I favor the BSD&#x2F;MIT&#x2F;ISC licenses to the GPL.<p>I very much like that FreeBSD is much more conservative about major changes, and open to choice, so we don&#x27;t get things <i>like</i> systemd, Pulseaudio, etc pushed on us before they are ready for production. I used to love this about Debian as well, but they&#x27;ve really lost their way as of late in pushing systemd on everyone before it was ready. I greatly value stability over whiz-bang bleeding edge features. I like that FreeBSD is run by a democratically elected core team instead of by a benevolent dictator (I don&#x27;t have to read what crazy thing Linus or Theo said today in the news.) I like that FreeBSD isn&#x27;t balkanized into hundreds of different distros. I <i>love</i> not having people telling me to say &quot;GNU&#x2F;FreeBSD&quot; whenever I mention FreeBSD.<p>I like the community of FreeBSD more, as it feels that most of the members are more technically oriented. Distros like Ubuntu have brought in a lot of users with little to no experience nor interest in learning the unix way of doing things. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing, or that I think less of eg Ubuntu users, just that I prefer the company of sysadmins and developers to laymen. I dislike that I can&#x27;t really discuss the OS with anyone in real life, because it&#x27;s too niche.",

Recently I decided to see how the competitor clouds offering stack up - because I&#x27;ve read a lot about how the second-movers in the space have caught up to Amazon. And that now there&#x27;s basically no difference between the offerings.<p>I decided first to try Google - specifically Google App Engine. Just to see if I could get a plain vanilla base case working quickly. And my initial reaction was that AWS is still head-and-shoulders above everyone (or at least Google). The Google UI and setup process seemed ridiculously complicated and unfriendly. With AWS, I was up and running almost immediately. Not so with Google.<p>So I immediately ran back to AWS and dropped Google. I&#x27;m not sure if my bad experience with Google was because I had framed my expectations through my AWS experience and thus wasn&#x27;t able to use Google the way it intended to be used. But it just seemed way too unfriendly. It seemed to require needless dev installs that should just be automated.<p>When I went back to AWS, just the sheer amount of services they offer seemed staggering by comparison. Google still has products in BETA that AWS has in mature mode.<p>I was going to try out other competitors like Azure, Digital Ocean, etc. but now feel like there&#x27;s no need. AWS is just good.",

  "text": "I started using FreeBSD (version 4.8 at the time) in 2003 and I began a switch to Ubuntu in around 2011.<p>Disclaimer: the following is all very opinionated and 8.1 is the last version of FreeBSD I actively used. Actually, it&#x27;s still running without any problems on a colocated machine, but it&#x27;s a bit a &quot;don&#x27;t touch it&quot; situation, because upgrading even a single piece of software would probably cause a cataclysm of struggle. So I don&#x27;t touch it (except for the occasional move of something to an Ubuntu vps), but it works like a charm.\nI&#x27;ve tried version 10 in a virtual machine because it had a new installer, but it was not the best experience ever (FreeBSD&#x27;s x.0 versions have always been better to skip, the x.1s were fine though). FreeBSD really needed a new installer and they did some great work, but it did not yet feel very solid. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve had to restart the Ubuntu installer often enough as well and I have a love&#x2F;hate relationship with both of them.<p>Okay, let&#x27;s hit it.<p>FreeBSD: it&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s minimal. It&#x27;s very good for learning *NIX stuff because you will have to do a lot of configuration yourself. What they do is very well done and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s hard to break it. Jails are very cool (OS level virtualization), but like everything else in the FreeBSD world, it&#x27;s quite some work to maintain. If it runs, it runs and will keep on running basically forever. If you want to upgrade stuff, brace, brace. The ports tree was amazing back in the day, but has been overtaken by stuff like apt-get. Installation of bash used to be like this: cd &#x2F;usr&#x2F;ports&#x2F;shells&#x2F;bash &amp;&amp; make install clean. And then, depending on your hardware and de ports dependencies, minutes or hours of waiting on the compilation. You can upgrade your base to any version without having to fear. You fetch a specific version, compile all the things (again, that is a lot of waiting), run mergemaster to fix up your configurations, reboot and you&#x27;re back.\nFreeBSD isn&#x27;t very cutting edge on the level of hardware support, but it comes with OpenBSD packet filter which is the best firewall ever, it&#x27;s very powerful yet easy to setup. Also, the zfs support is awesome. That file system is truly amazing, very flexible and serious about data integrity. It&#x27;s cool until it breaks though, &#x27;cause you&#x27;ll be diving deep in obscure Solaris documentation and just praying to get your data back. But, I had zfs on an external USB drive and you just shouldn&#x27;t do that. With built-in drives you&#x27;ll probably be very safe with zfs.\nTo sum it up: if you&#x27;re patient, care about technology and have a lot of time, FreeBSD is truly a marvellous operating system that will never let you down. It&#x27;s solid stuff and it&#x27;s serious, but it is an investment.<p>Ubuntu: as someone who started with FreeBSD, Linux always felt a bit messy to me. We, the FreeBSD users at the time, used to make fun of Linux guys saying they have scripts for everything. And in some way I still think that&#x27;s true. ;) The scripts in init.d very often have &#x27;issues&#x27;. Ubuntu does a lot of stuff for you automatically. Installation of software couldn&#x27;t be much easier and many times there&#x27;s not much to configure. A &#x27;disadvantage&#x27; is that you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time figuring out how the software does and what all it&#x27;s options are, it just works. The way configuration files are organised is pretty neat, with almost everything in it&#x27;s own dir in &#x2F;etc&#x2F; and foo.d dirs for adding extra options in small config files. (This is very contrary to FreeBSD, where you have one big &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.conf to configure the stuff that starts when booting and where you can define extra parameters for the software. There&#x27;s &#x2F;etc&#x2F; for configuring the base system and &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;etc&#x2F; for placing files for software that&#x27;s not in base.) When you&#x27;re used to pf, iptables is just shit (but ufw helps a lot). It&#x27;s such a struggle to configure.<p>So why did I switch from FreeBSD to Ubuntu? Reason number one is because the place where I started working had done that. I really loved FreeBSD and I didn&#x27;t really had that feeling towards Linux, but using Linux in day to day life is just a lot easier. It&#x27;s more common, most people use Linux so you don&#x27;t have to do &#x27;BSD specific stuff&#x27;. Also, I loved doing all the configuration stuff years back, but I know how it&#x27;s done now and I mostly just want my stuff to work without spending hours on configuration and maintenance. You can do that with one FreeBSD server without any problem, but when you have to manage around 50 servers, it becomes quite a thing. Installing a new kernel on an Ubuntu server or upgrading software is super easy and you don&#x27;t have to wait for hours because you don&#x27;t have to compile all the stuff.<p>To conclude, I&#x27;d say: just give FreeBSD a try, it&#x27;s never a bad idea to have a look at what others do. I just wouldn&#x27;t advise rolling it out to lots of servers, unless you have a very specific reason to do so.",

I think one of the highlights was one of the server-wide tournaments that was run, with the prizes being &quot;legendary&quot; character names (and stats).  I almost won that.  In one of the final rounds, my opponent fell into a hole on a treacherous map with level 9 cliffs on it before a single shot was fired.  I took a &quot;role playing&quot; approach to it and allowed him to restart because it wasn&#x27;t an honorable win.  I was winning the re-match until I got taken out by a BS engine crit.  Oh well.",

The reality was technical leadership stopped a level below director, and only 2 or 3 even managed to make it that far.  After 3.5 years there, it had a formative impact of pushing me away from both the company and technology.  I recovered on both, but it&#x27;s something one should take seriously on taking a job.  I&#x27;m not sure that creating &quot;Mega-consultants&quot; works either, as it takes the emphasis away from delivery ownership.<p>That said, here are a few ideas in rank order from easy&#x2F;feasible to crazy&#x2F;radical:<p>1)  Technical leaders of a certain level can not be overruled on technical decisions by non-technical leaders in the department.<p>2)  Encourage the best to share their work outside the firm.<p>3)  Smart people like to be with smart people.  Pay up for a culture or cohort of superstars, not an individual superstar.<p>4)  Provide time and monetary budget for architecture and technical debt that is owned and allocated by the best in the organization.<p>5)  Allow technical stars to have the ability to change assignments at their will with a given notice period.  (Yes it may cause problems, but the free market is always giving them offers)<p>6)  Enable managers to raise technical pay without concern for bands.  For example, the VP should be able to say, &quot;I can hire 4 engineers for 100K each, or I can hire someone in the open market for 200K.  Instead I will pay my internal superstar 220K since she will do it the best, even though it&#x27;s way out of bands of someone with her seniority and level.&quot;",

CEO&#x27;s are paid ridiculous amounts because the perception is almost no one can do the job. Janitors are paid little because the perception is almost anyone can do the job. The result of this is that many buildings are cleaned poorly, so nxt time you see a dirty bathroom, don&#x27;t blame the janitor, blame the person hiring the janitor.

Good programmers can make or break a business by building software which sells itself, or by building software with 10 times less effort, turning loss into profit, but many people hiring the programmers don&#x27;t see it that way, so many programming jobs underpay, and many people paid to program have no business being anywhere near a keyboard.",

In fact, if a worker captures <i>all</i> of the value, there would be no benefit to the employer.<p>The point of the post is that we aren&#x27;t in a labor <i>bubble</i>, because the amount of value created by a programmer is much higher than the programmer&#x27;s salary.  For instance, suppose that a contractor installing marble countertops on luxury houses out in the desert gets paid 100k a year.  It turns out that the value of those countertops is below 100k a year.  This could be used to suggest that the jobs themselves will disappear (or salaries must drop dramatically), as the value they generate isn&#x27;t sufficient to justify that pay.<p>Now suppose installing those countertops generate 200k a year in value, but that it is relatively easy.  That would suggest that salaries could drop even though there is a surplus of value in the existing salary structure.  However, it wouldn&#x27;t suggest that salaries need to drop because value generated isn&#x27;t sufficient to justify the pay level.<p>I think that&#x27;s the point here - that the amount of value generated is so great that programmer salaries could remain high.

I know in Florida where I am, non-competes are very frowned upon in the legal system if they are too broad, overly prohibitive or for more than 2 years (in general). The key is an employer cannot prevent you from working in your field of expertise, and they cannot prevent you from using your knowledge to help others, except that they can hold you accountable not to disclose or utilize company specific knowledge.  That is sometimes hard to define, but usually is the secret sauce that makes something unique. Also, this changes the higher up in the company management you go too, execs are treated different than say a developer would be.<p>I had a company want me to sign a non-compete that said I wouldn&#x27;t take any job where I would work with GPS, geographical systems, or location aware systems for a period of 4 years anywhere in the United States (this was a Florida Company).  This was a firm involved with financial software for the lending industry.  I just told them that 1, it is way to broad and I can&#x27;t sign it, and 2, btw it isn&#x27;t going to pass muster here in Florida because it is too prohibitive and way too broad not to mention too long.  I had a good relationship with the company (and owner) so I felt comfortable telling them what I felt from having been involved in non-compete structure with my last company.  What I did agree to is saying for a period of 12 months leaving their job I would not help any other financial software services firm develop a geographical based algorithm.  I think in the end we settled on 18 months, but it worked out.<p>Not being an attorney, I did go ask an attorney and paid for an hour of guidance and I did the negotiation to keep it non-confrontational.

In software development, tasks can be parcelled out in a modular way to many developers. But this model doesn&#x27;t work well for visual and interaction design. If you want all the parts of an Operating System or piece of software to feel consistent and cohesive, you need a more focused approach. And that means handing design tasks to a designated design team and entrusting them to make the UX decisions. But with open source projects, we all want a say in the UX (me included); thus the endless (and often bitter) discussions about how a piece of software should behave.<p>The model of open source code has influenced and inspired countless companies. But who can point to examples of visual and interaction design from open source software that has had a similar effect? I see the influence going much more the other way i.e. open source software often follows ideas or conventions from commercial companies. I&#x27;d love to see this change. But how?",

  "text": "I just gave the FIX log example because that&#x27;s what I am familiar with, that&#x27;s all. :-)<p>&gt;  Are firms actively looking for people with these kinds of skills?<p>Generally, I used to use efinancialcareers.com and other industry-specific recruiters to gauge demand. On the flow side &#x2F; sell-side, unless you have elevated into a more quant-focused role, the IT folks often end up dealing with FIX, but I suppose it also depends on which instrument...I was in equities.<p>&gt; Finally, you mentioned I&#x27;m underpaid--what do you recommend I ask for in terms of a raise, and after how many months would it be appropriate? I&#x27;m a few months in and this is my first job ever because I did the master&#x27;s right after my bachelors.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m in Hong Kong and I don&#x27;t have a pulse on NYC salaries right now. I somehow thought you had some years of experience, so the salary you mentioned may not even be low if this is your first job?<p>If I was in your situation, I would do a survey among my friends to gauge the appropriate salary. Be careful about recruiters&#x27; opinions, though : it benefits them to make you feel dissatisfied at your present job, so they may exaggerate how much you could get if you jumped jobs. If the gap is too much, I would immediately put in a word in with my manager : &quot;Hey, I was just talking to my friends and I found out that I started off at the lowest salary among the bunch. On the average, the difference is $40k or more. Do you think you can revise my base or bonus at some point in the future?&quot;. It is politically important to put it across as a concern &#x2F; request, not as an aggressive stand. If the gap in salary between you and your batchmates at other places is not that much, you can wait till the year-end &#x2F; half-year review...<p>Plus, there are all the other issues of your employer&#x27;s brand-name, the kind of work you do, how nice your colleagues are to you, how nice of a person is your boss, etc;...All these have tremendous value, too, and employers are keenly aware of their brand-value as well as whether the work you are being allowed to do is coveted, and don&#x27;t hesitate to pay you less than market-rate if either factor comes into play!<p>&gt; Knowing this, would you still recommend I stay in finance?<p>Yes, finance is so large an industry that stereotypes need not apply to you. For example, Jane Street is much more respectful of good coders &#x2F; thinkers has a startup feel to it. You can aspire to join such a small firm rather than JPM, GS, or other axis-of-evil participants. :-) Or you can join a smaller buy-side shop, etc;<p>The top three things I would suggest doing are a) network; need not be aggressive; just do things you like with other people. Go to an R meetup or python meetup, for example. Meetups hosted at other firms&#x27; offices are a great way to check them out and get intel on what the industry is like outside your firm b) identify fields of interest and become good at them; could be tech, could be particular instruments of trading, etc; c) wait. Wait until the field and the players become more clear. Wait until you come across a firm or opportunity that makes you go, &quot;Wow, I&#x27;d like to work there &#x2F; on that!&quot;. Then the energy will come to you naturally. Or maybe you see them all and it becomes really clear that you don&#x27;t even want to be in NY?<p>I think it&#x27;s great that you posted on HN and asked for advice. It&#x27;s great that you acknowledged that you are dissatisfied. The tricky part after seeing a problem is waiting. :-) The natural tendency is to jump to a solution, and often, we just simply pick the thing that looks most different from where we&#x27;re uncomfortable (startups instead of finance; SV instead of NY, etc;). Staying with the discomfort till your feelings crystallize more clearly is probably the most tricky yet important skill for anyone.",

But in order to really have just been able to use this it needs:<p>1) The cores need to run modern x86 so its a simple matter of just running the binary.\n2) The offloading and concept of heterogeneous cores needs to be added into the operating system. All the cores should be exposed to programs and then putting threads onto accelerators ought to be something a hint can suggest or maybe a special type of parallel thread created. In essence the OS needs to be exposing them like any other core with shared memory and everything else this entails to make it native.<p>The current model that GPUs use is very good for doing matrices of data but it really doesn&#x27;t lend itself to agents or other types of concurrency. Its a bit of a stretch to be writing in a restricted form of C which is pretty low level with openCL or DirectCompute combined with all the API and data passing overhead its a very specific type of program that benefits and it requires rewriting your code completely. The future can&#x27;t possibly be this in the general case and its not really being adopted all that widely, some people are using it of course but most aren&#x27;t.<p>In my opinion lots of low power cores that run the same instruction set as the primary CPU gives us a useful middle ground that is easier to use and optimise for and can be used alongside the primary fast cores of the main CPU.

So in this case 500 C and -160 C are 773 K and 113 K so:<p>Carnot efficiency = (773 - 113)&#x2F;773 = 85.4%<p>It’s a handy approximation for the most efficiency that could be expected from other cycles.  So for example an internal combustion (Otto cycle) engine running below the temperature of boiling water would have an expected efficiency at room temperature of about 68 F or 20 C or 293 K of:<p>Carnot efficiency = (373 - 293)&#x2F;373 = 21.5%<p>Whereas jet (Brayton cycle) engines may have a temperature differential of 1000 C:<p>Carnot efficiency = (1293 - 293)&#x2F;1293 = 77.3%<p>Things are a bit more complicated than this because with active cooling it’s not just the temperature of the engine’s components, but the temperature of the exhaust gasses, efficiencies of valves, compressors, turbines, etc.  So modern internal combustion engines may reach 25% efficiency and turbines may reach 45% efficiency but I still find the Carnot cycle good for guestimation.<p>So for example, I remember research in the 90s for making ceramic internal combustion engines lubricated with graphite or exhaust that would run at a higher temperature and have an efficiency closer to jet engines.  There were also working Stirling engine cars that would have gotten significantly better mileage because it’s more practical to approach the Carnot limit with the Stirling cycle than the Otto cycle:<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Vnxapd5fs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=H_Vnxapd5fs</a><p>The main tradeoff is that there hasn’t been as much research in high compression Stirling engines so they tend to have a higher volume than internal combustion engines at the same power output.  But since Stirling engines have significantly fewer moving parts and use external combustion (meaning they can run on any fuel), I could never quite figure out why they were never mass produced.  Perhaps if they had been, we would have seen industrial sized Stirling engines with Argon as the working fluid decades ago.<p>Then again, before the web and Wikipedia it would have been hard to make these kinds of points at a Thanksgiving dinner table.",

You are awfully hostile for someone who just wants to learn.  BSD operating systems are operating systems.  The full OS means the full OS.  Plain and simple.  The lack of distinction between the OS and third party packages is unique to linux distros, where the OS itself consists almost entirely of third party packages in the first place.  In BSD systems as in most systems, the operating system is everything included in the operating system, and third party software is third party software.<p>&gt;it includes every possible package<p>This is one of the fundamental differences, which is why it seems to odd that you claim to be talking about the differences but you don&#x27;t even know them.<p>&gt;I meant small in terms of packages.

Naturally you will see people with their workflows based on that, or some indirect form of that.  And these people have working systems, no matter how much people wax philosophical and longingly on forums for &quot;missing&quot; features that are irrelevant to people with already working systems.<p>So from a certain perspective it&#x27;s a bit weird to see something like a slide here say that such a system needs to address 99% of people.  Who says?  It&#x27;s working fine in its niche.<p>I think there is also a very simple difference of opinion and difference in personality types here, in a way that I don&#x27;t often see people acknowledge.  On one side you have people who crave authority, order, centralization.  One component to manage boot and hardware.  One UI toolkit.  Choice is bad, freedom is slavery.  (OK, just joking on that last one.)  Then there are people who just happen to like it the other way.  I&#x27;m <i>glad</i> that some systems don&#x27;t bring up a GUI until I ask for one, and even then, it can be whatever I say it is.  I find it pleasingly simple that the OpenBSD upgrade instructions basically tell you to run tar and patch.

  "text": "I doubt the GP was thinking of this, but there exist some interesting side-channel information attacks using the electricity grid.<p>(disclaimer: I am not very knowledgeable about electricity&#x2F;electronics, so forgive me if I&#x27;m a bit hand-wavy or wrong about the details)<p>The actual electricity output from a wall-socket fluctuates continuously by a tiny bit over time. I suppose this goes for both the exact magnitude of power output (is that voltage or amperes?) and the exact frequency being ever-so-slightly above or below the expected 50Hz. These fluctuations can be measured (or fingerprinted) by carefully measuring the output of electrical appliances, such as the crackles and pops in audio recordings or brightness of light bulbs, and in fact many other things.<p>The other important fact in this trick is that apparently these fluctuations are all the same over the entire grid (or subsections of it, I guess, depending on network layout). They are also pretty much random. This means that if you keep a log of these fluctuations over time, you can timestamp recordings of pretty much anything with extreme accuracy, by matching up the patterns of crackles or power fluctuations in the recordings to your logs.<p>This would then allow one to detect fake call logs, video&#x2F;audio cuts and splices, stuff like that.<p>It&#x27;s not a gigantic privacy risk (therefore probably not what the GP was thinking of), at least not from the applications I can think of the top of my head. I do love side-channel attacks like these, though. They&#x27;re always so clever and out-of-the-box :)",

You want to understand why you&#x27;re using the algorithm  before you begin working on how to implement the algorithm. As an extreme example, consider us teaching the Quicksort and the Bogosort as pure implementation but without explanation on usage. Granted, this is unlikely to ever happen, but it serves to illustrate that this kind of knowledge is part of the understanding of any algorithm, or even further, any concept.<p>Now the context you&#x27;re referring to regarding your &quot;implementing ols&quot; example seems to be largely assorted trivia to be honest. They don&#x27;t know the answer, they&#x27;re filling in  something, and have done so through highschool and then college because something might get mercy marks. I&#x27;d like to disagree on giving that the moniker meta-knowledge, it&#x27;s losely tied factoids at best.<p>I completely agree that deep understanding of concepts is incredibly important, but i think it&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;ll see large scale change in that attitude. The way I see incentive structures for students, making that shift unconsciously is disincentivised, since moving from a cramming schedule to a more thourough approach puts you even further behind temporarily which hurts your grades. The fact that any kind of disaster or holdup could push you into the former style of learning is what I think causes the entire thing to tilt.<p>Whilst there are a couple more points I&#x27;d love to adress, I kinda want to question your assertion that this is a current generation thing. That is an awfully easy assertion to make, can usually be said about the asserters generation as well and all generations before that. Unless there&#x27;s more concrete data to back that part up, i think it does the present generation plenty of injustice.",

  "text": "I have introduced FreeBSD at a number of companies, and I&#x27;m a big fan of it, but also like Debian and Ubuntu a lot. Here are some things I like about FreeBSD:<p>* Since it&#x27;s all developed in a smaller community, and FreeBSD hackers&#x2F;users tend to be pretty opinionated about many things, most subsystems have a consistent feel and are very unsurprising. This makes that you can often guess and be right. It also means you don&#x27;t get to have some hyped trends. (I have the same feeling about the Go language and community by the way.)<p>* This might be subjective but I feel that many administration tasks are very transparent, orthogonal and simple. Many system configuration, like enabling of services, network configuration, can be changed by a simple setting in a &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.conf shellvariables file with defaults in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;defaults&#x2F;rc.conf. Stuff ends up in understandable text config files. Comments and options tend to be simple and don&#x27;t require --lots-of-long-options --which-i-cant-ever-remember which GNU utils seem to really love :(<p>* The base system is being developed in a conservative way. We never reinstall servers for a major upgrade, we just upgrade running systems forever. We have some boxes that come from FreeBSD 6.0 (2005) and were gradually bumped up without reinstalling. There is little switching around of subsystems, so you don&#x27;t often have to learn replacements (like ipfwadm&#x2F;ipchains&#x2F;iptables). The OS is just a vehicle to me, please don&#x27;t complicate my life needlessly!<p>* The storage options are pretty nice. ZFS is now a common buzzword so I won&#x27;t go into it, also Linux is now getting a good replacement in btrfs. But I also like FreeBSD&#x27;s GEOM, which has a lot of &#x27;building blocks&#x27; that you can stack on eachother. For instance, you can use gmirror to create a RAID1 mirror, then use geli to create an encrypted volume on top of that.<p>* The ports&#x2F;packages collection is a rolling release and generally has very new versions of apps from OpenJDK to Node to PHP etc. In my mind, it&#x27;s best to keep your app stack continuously fresh, compared with lagging and doing large upgrades every few years. That way you get security updates from the app authors constantly, instead of from maintainers who backport it. I actually prefer this, since upgrading apps creates tangible value for our developers and customers, but it&#x27;s a tradeoff. If you want to be hands-off, set-and-forget, no-budget-for-maintenance, then you might be better off with an Ubuntu LTS or RHEL strategy of locking apps into old versions with backported fixes. But damn, I cringe whenever I see a box with PHP 5.3...<p>* If you compile ports yourself, the port maintainers often create configurable options so you can build stuff with your own preferences. This is very useful for instance if you need ffmpeg with some specific codecs. It can be a real drag on Linux to get it just right. Creating your own binary package repository with your favorite custom options is super easy.<p>* We distribute that stuff like crazy (e.g. on appliances), and it&#x27;s nice to be able to do that without having too much fear about the GPL(v3).<p>That said, there&#x27;s some positive points about Linux (mostly Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian here):<p>* Desktop support is undoubtedly better on Linux right now. FreeBSD desktops seem a bit like Linux desktops were in the &#x27;00s: manual twiddling, lots of tweaking, having to really watch what video and wireless hardware you get. PC-BSD should be better in this regard, but I haven&#x27;t tried BSD on the desktop for years now. But I&#x27;m tempted to give it another try.<p>* I think AppArmor is a really cool way to constrain applications without going the whole container way, for which FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t have an equivalent right now.<p>* While I&#x27;m skeptical about systemd&#x27;s overreaching goals, I do agree that it is time to centralize service and event management. It&#x27;s not a critical issue to me however, I&#x27;m not too bothered by the old inits for instance. So hopefully FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t have to have a big controversy and pick the &#x27;good parts&#x27;.<p>* Obviously Linux has a lot of momentum right now, so using it might be less of a long term risk in terms of support, hiring, etc.",

Other than that, there has never been an upgrade where something broke. Now, sure, it is wise to check the Arch homepage before you upgrade, just in case some action needs to be taken: that&#x27;s something that you don&#x27;t really have to do with, e.g., Debian. But if you do that, as I&#x27;ve done, you probably will never have major problems upgrading.<p>In fact, I actually dread Ubuntu updates far more ... I&#x27;ve had them break various and sundry things about my (previously-working) system. In my experience, at least, Ubuntu is far less stable than Arch. With that said, though, I haven&#x27;t used Ubuntu since 12.04 and 10.04 before that, so I don&#x27;t know how it fares anymore.",

  "text": "I&#x27;ll also say that my favorite tactic was often labeled a griefer tactic although I&#x27;ll still vehemently disagree with that assessment.<p>In the first couple of months I had a lot of advantages. I&#x27;d already been playing for months so was familiar w&#x2F; the ins and outs of the game - this led to me being one of the first GM mages on the server (when magery was the only way to really fight). I had a fast connection and single digit pings when most people were just starting to get 28.8 modems - I was often accused of cheating as I&#x27;d appear to warp around people&#x27;s screens (from my perspective I could easily overtake people who were riding horses when I was on foot). While I wasn&#x27;t particularly good at PvP from a player skill perspective, I had enough advantages that I could count on 2 hands the number of people I actually feared.<p>At the time <i>many</i> new players would find themselves dastardly due to clicking on the wrong thing once or twice - they didn&#x27;t even mean to do anything wrong and half the time it was due to lag. So what I&#x27;d do is dress up in newb gear, hang outside the dungeon near Britain and pretend to be very lagged. At the time you couldn&#x27;t see people&#x27;s skill levels (stuff like this is why they put that in) so you&#x27;d just see my character name, that I was dastardly, I appeared to be a n00b and I could barely move.<p>So then these brave souls would attack me, often in a pack - not because they actually thought I was a bad person but because they a) could and b) I was an easy target who couldn&#x27;t fight back. I&#x27;m sure you can see where this is going, after I&#x27;d wipe the floor with their whole crew they&#x27;d come back and call me a cheater and a horrible human being. Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t the one attacking a defenseless n00b.<p>And yes, one could argue this from an RP perspective that in fact my char <i>was</i> a criminal and they were meting out justice but approximately 0.1% of people actually were doing that despite what they&#x27;d claim, the rest were just being turds.",
